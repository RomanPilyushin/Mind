### Problem

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

### Input Output


**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "()"
**Output:** true



**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "()[]{}"
**Output:** true



**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "(]"
**Output:** false



**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.


### Approach to Solve the Problem:

To solve this problem, we can use a **stack**. A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, which is perfect for this problem because we need to ensure that the most recent opening bracket is closed first.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Initialize a Stack**:
    
    - We will use a stack to keep track of opening brackets as we encounter them in the string.
2. **Traverse the String**:
    
    - For each character in the string:
        - **If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`)**:
            - Push it onto the stack.
        - **If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`)**:
            - Check if the stack is not empty (which means there's an unmatched opening bracket).
            - Pop the top of the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket.
            - If it doesn't match, return `false` (invalid string).
    - If the stack is empty after processing the entire string, it means all opening brackets have been matched and closed properly, so return `true`.
    - If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so return `false`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's walk through the examples provided:

#### Example 1: `s = "()"`

- Traverse the string:
    - First character: `(` is an opening bracket, so push it onto the stack.
    - Second character: `)` is a closing bracket. The stack is not empty, and the top of the stack is `(`, which matches `)`, so pop the stack.
- After traversing the string, the stack is empty. Therefore, the string is valid, and the function returns `true`.

#### Example 2: `s = "()[]{}"`

- Traverse the string:
    - First character: `(` is an opening bracket, so push it onto the stack.
    - Second character: `)` is a closing bracket. The stack is not empty, and the top of the stack is `(`, which matches `)`, so pop the stack.
    - Third character: `[` is an opening bracket, so push it onto the stack.
    - Fourth character: `]` is a closing bracket. The stack is not empty, and the top of the stack is `[`, which matches `]`, so pop the stack.
    - Fifth character: `{` is an opening bracket, so push it onto the stack.
    - Sixth character: `}` is a closing bracket. The stack is not empty, and the top of the stack is `{`, which matches `}`, so pop the stack.
- After traversing the string, the stack is empty. Therefore, the string is valid, and the function returns `true`.

#### Example 3: `s = "(]"`

- Traverse the string:
    - First character: `(` is an opening bracket, so push it onto the stack.
    - Second character: `]` is a closing bracket. The stack is not empty, but the top of the stack is `(`, which does not match `]`. So, the function returns `false` (invalid string).

### Constraints:

- The function needs to handle strings with lengths up to 10,000. The stack-based solution works efficiently within this constraint since both the time and space complexity are **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

### Code

```cpp
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

bool isValid(std::string s) {
    std::stack<char> stack;
    std::unordered_map<char, char> matchingBrackets = {
        {')', '('},
        {']', '['},
        {'}', '{'}
    };

    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '(' || c == '[' || c == '{') {
            stack.push(c);
        } else {
            if (stack.empty() || stack.top() != matchingBrackets[c]) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.pop();
        }
    }

    return stack.empty();
}
```


### Explanation of the Code:

- **Stack**: Used to keep track of the opening brackets.
- **MatchingBrackets Map**: A map that defines which opening bracket corresponds to which closing bracket.
- **For Loop**: Iterates over each character in the string, managing the stack according to the rules described.

### Summary:

The solution effectively uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket is matched with the correct closing bracket in the right order. If all conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
