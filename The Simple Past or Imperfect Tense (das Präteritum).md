### The Simple Past Tense in English

The simple past describes an event within a time frame that is completed (compare the simple past "I cooked twice this week" with the [present perfect,](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Perfect/Perfect.html) "I have cooked twice this week" — the former implies that that's all the cooking I'm going to do, while the latter leaves open the possibility that I might cook more).


English forms this tense in several ways:

Weak verbs add _-ed_: "looked," "wanted," "worked," etc.

Strong, or irregular, verbs generally change the vowel in the stressed syllable. A variety of other changes are possible, as well: "ate," "sang," "held," "went," "thought," etc.


### The Simple Past Tense in German


In German, as in English, the simple past differs from the [present perfect,](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Perfect/Perfect.html) in that it describes past events that are interrelated within a time frame that is separate from the present. Hence it is typically used in narratives. German speakers are not always careful in making this distinction. Indeed, they sometimes even mix the two tenses indiscriminately.

#### Weak erbs


**Weak verbs** form the simple past by adding _-(e)te_, _-(e)test_, _-(e)ten_, or _-(e)tet_ to the stem:

|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Wir machten die Tür zu. | We closed the door.     |
| Du kauftest zu viel.    | You bought too much.    |

#### Strong verbs


The remaining [**strong verbs**](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Verbs/StrongVerbs.html) (usually) change the stem and add either no ending or _-st_, _-en_, or _-t_:


| Ich ging nach Hause.          | I went home.             |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Wir sahen ihn nicht.          | We didn't see him.       |

#### Distinctions between the Simple Past and the Present Perfect


In spoken German, the simple past is perceived as formal. Colloquial narratives often use the [present perfect tense:](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Perfect/Perfect.html) "Ich bin nach Hause gegangen und habe meinem Mann gesagt...." 

Indeed, many dialects do not have a simple past. The simple past is reserved for more formal narratives; novels are one example.

In ordinary conversation, then, the simple past is unusual. There are however, a few exceptions, primarily the verbs "sein," "haben," and the [modal auxiliaries](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Verbs/modals.html). It is quite common to say: "ich war da", instead of "ich bin da gewesen"; "wir hatten eine Katze", instead of "wir haben eine Katze gehabt"; or "sie konnte ihn sehen", rather than "sie hat ihn sehen können." This is particularly true when it serves to cut down on complexity. Even in ordinary speech it is more usual to say "ich musste einen Arzt rufen lassen" than "ich habe einen Arzt rufen lassen müssen."

#### Separable prefix


As in the [present tense,](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Present/Present.html) the finite verb might have a [separable prefix](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Wortbildung/Separables.html), which then goes to the end of the clause:


| Wir kauften immer montags ein.      | We always shopped on Monday.          |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Sie brachte ihren neuen Freund mit. |  She brought her new boyfriend along. |
| Er lud uns dieses Mal nicht ein.    | He didn't invite us this time.        |
| Er rief seine Mutter nie an.        | He never phoned his mother.           |
