### Problem

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.

### Input Output

**Example 1:**
**Input:** list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
**Output:** [1,1,2,3,4,4]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** list1 = [], list2 = []
**Output:** []

**Example 3:**

**Input:** list1 = [], list2 = [0]
**Output:** [0]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.


### Solution


1. **Class Declaration**:
    
    - The `mergeTwoSortedLists` class is defined in the header file (`mergeTwoSortedLists.h`), and the method `mergeTwoLists` is declared within this class.
2. **Method Definition**:
    
    - The method `mergeTwoLists` is defined in the implementation file (`mergeTwoSortedLists.cpp`). It takes two sorted linked lists as input and merges them into one sorted linked list.
3. **Dummy Node**:
    
    - A dummy node is used to simplify the merging process. It provides a starting point for the merged list.
4. **Merge Logic**:
    
    - The two lists are traversed, and the smaller of the two current nodes is appended to the merged list. This continues until one of the lists is exhausted.
    - The remaining elements of the non-exhausted list are appended to the merged list.
5. **Returning the Result**:
    
    - After merging, the dummy node is discarded, and the head of the merged list is returned.

### Summary:

This setup defines the `mergeTwoSortedLists` class with a `mergeTwoLists` method that properly merges two sorted linked lists. The code structure includes the appropriate header and implementation files, and the method is correctly linked to the class. This should resolve the issue of the class not having a member `mergeTwoLists`.
