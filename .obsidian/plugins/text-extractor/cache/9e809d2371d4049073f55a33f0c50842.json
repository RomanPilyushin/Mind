As time went by, my ideas changed, expanded, and matured, and I improved each subsequent edition with new material that reflected this shift in perspective. This growing process continued and it became clear to me that a vast overhaul in my chess teaching philosophy necessitated a final edition. Those that enjoyed past editions will discover that I literally wrote this fourth edition from scratch- all new examples, all new prose, highlighted by lots of humor and some very original ways of presenting the material. One thing was true of all the earlier editions: none were computer checked since powerful chess engines weren't readily available. However, now we're in a different age, and since the advent of computers in every household allows players of any rating to find the flaws in my (and others) analysis, I made a point of putting every position in this edition though a detailed analytical check by both Rybka 3 and Fritz 12. Though I concentrated on concepts over soulless analysis because I thought too many varia­ tions can drown out a book's message, there were times when I gave lines that I felt highlighted the point I was trying to make, or presented a detailed analysis that simply was so bizarre or exciting that I didn't have the heart not to include it in the festivities. This fourth edition is the result of a lifetime of chess coaching and tournament com­ petition. I've removed the extraneous elements from previous editions since I wanted to stay \"on point\" as much as possible. In fact, I tossed out anything and everything that I felt distracted from the book's real purpose: mastering the imbalances and allowing them to guide you to the correct plans and moves in most positions. On top of that, I also integrated quite a bit of chess psychology into the lessons-you'll find that many of these ideas have never been seen in any chess book before. More than two decades after I wrote the first edition of How to Reassess Your Chess, I still get many kind letters from all over the globe. This new edition will please those that wanted more \"Reassess\" material, and it will also introduce a whole new generation to a system that makes chess far easier to grasp and thus far easier to enjoy. It's always been my passion to help people who feel chess mastery is somehow beyond them to undergo a paradigm shift in their chess consciousness. How to Reassess Your Chess, 4th Edition was written to elicit that kind of experience. If it helps you, the reader, to grasp facets of chess that were previously invisible, then the years I spent writing this book will be very well spent. I would like to thank all my students, who, over the years, have given me permission to use their games as instructive templates. In particular, I must give Pam Ruggiero (aka girl-brain) a full salute for sending me dozens of her games, some of which showed a high level of chess understanding, and others which illustrated weaknesses that most amateur players also share (thereby making these examples invaluable). A debt of gratitude is also owed to both New In Chess, which allowed me to use various quotes from their wonderful magazine, and www.chess.com, that let me reprint some of the articles I wrote for them. I must give some love to my \"posse\"-Dr. Manuel Monasterio and the inimi­ table Vance Aandahl, Grandmasters Yasser Seirawan and Joel Benjamin, and International Masters John Watson, John Donaldson, Dr. Anthony Saidy, and Jack Peters. All of them helped with alternative piece names, analysis, and/or the sharing of general ideas that ultimately enriched the book. Finally, I want to give a hearty thank you to International Master Elliott Winslow, who was happily retired from all chess-related things, only to be dragged screaming back into the fold when I nagged him, again and again, to put his life on hold and proof this book. Realizing that he had to shut me up or go insane, he ultimately complied. How to Reassess Your Chess is all about turning you, the chess student/lover of the game, into a player with superb positional understanding and skills. You may ask, \"Why do I need another instructive chess book?\" The answer is: Look at your rating. Look at your playing strength. Do you feel like you have superb positional skills? If not, wouldn't you like to have them? As a chess teacher and, more importantly, as a student of the game that person­ ally ran into many hard-to-scale learning plateaus, I fully understand the frustration chess fans experience when they find themselves frozen at a particular skill level. It's my belief that every player needs a firm chess foundation to reach his potential, and the lack of such a foundation more or less forestalls any real hope of attaining the chess heights most players dream of. How to Reassess Your Chess, 4th Edition was designed for players in the 1400 to 2100 range. A close study of its contents will imbue the serious student with a rock solid positional chess foundation, an appreciation of planning plus an understand­ ing of how to make logical plans based on the needs of the position, and surprising insights into previously ignored areas of chess psychology. By employing new ways of presenting concepts and games, and by making the book feel both personal and fun to read, I've done everything possible to ensure that studying becomes a joy and that the material presented-often viewed as too complex for the masses-will suddenly make sense and, as a result, be remarkably easy to retain. Ideally, this fourth edition should be read from beginning to end. However, two indexes add to the ways the book can be read. One acts as both a games' index and a list-of-players' index, and can be used to find all the games in the book by a favorite player or, at a glance, just see who played whom. The other index is about chess concepts, and can prove to be a very useful study tool-for example, if you wish to study isolated pawns, just look that up in the index and go to each listed page. This lets you make a detailed examination of any particular concept that interests you. A word about the examples: you'll notice that I've used games by grandmasters and also games by amateurs! I've used new games, and I've also used games from the seventeenth century! I made use of blitz games from the Internet, and even used the blitz players' online names. I have a simple philosophy: if a position or game is instructive, it's important. I don't care if Kasparov played it, or if it's beginner vs. beginner. In fact, lower rated games and/or blitz games often feature the kind of XIV HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION errors real players make, and this makes the example far more personal for a large range of readers. To top it all off, I didn't shy away from employing humor if I felt it added to the lesson being taught, or improved the book's overall readability. Who said that it's not possible to study chess, learn advanced concepts, and laugh at the same time? I tell stories in the book that push home a point and also entertain. I used online handles because they are colorful and add to the example's fun-quotient. Why shouldn't chess study be fun? I honestly believe that a thorough study of this book will take you on an enlight­ ening journey that, ultimately, will shatter your old chess misconceptions and drag you laughing into a Golden Age of chess understanding and chess enjoyment. \"A sound plan makes us all heroes, the absence of a plan, idiots.\" -G.M. Kotov, quoting a mysterious \"chess sage.\" At some time or other every tournament player learns a few opening lines, some tactical ideas, the most basic mating patterns, and a few elementary endgames. As he gets better and more experienced, he significantly adds to this knowledge. However, the one thing that just about everybody has problems with is planning. From class \"E\" (under 1200) to Master, I get blank stares when asking what plan they had in mind in a particular position. Usually their choice of a plan (if they have any plan at all) is based on emotional rather than chess-specific con­ siderations. By emotional, I mean that the typical player does what he feels like doing rather than what the board is telling him to do. This somewhat cryptic sentence leads us to the following extremely important concept: If you want to be successful, you have to base your moves and plans on the specific imbalance-oriented criteria that exist in the given position, not on your mood, tastes, and/or fears! Literally every non-master's games are filled with examples of \"imbalance avoidance.\" Beginners, of course, simply don't know what imbalances are. Most experienced players have heard the term and perhaps have even tried to make use of them from time to time; however, once the rush of battle takes over, iso­ lated moves and raw aggression (or terror, if you find yourself defending) push any and all thoughts of imbalances out the door. In this case, chess becomes an empty move-by-move, threat-by-threat (either making them or responding to them) affair. What is this mysterious allusion to the chessboard's desires (i.e., doing what the chessboard wants you to do)? What is this \"imbalance-oriented criteria\" that we are going to have to become aware of, and how do we master its use? What, exactly, is a plan? To answer these questions, the first thing we have to do is understand that an imbalance is any significant difference in the two respective positions. 4 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION This sounds rather vacuous. How can such a simplistic thing be important? The answer is that it's far from simplistic, and that this easy-to-grasp concept allows any player from 1400 on up to understand most positions in a basic but logical fashion. In other words, where a position may have looked much too complex to fathom, the imbalances deconstruct it in a way that makes it user friendly. Here's a simple example: if one side has more queenside space while the other side is staring at his opponent's weak pawn, those are the imbalances that delineate the moves and plans that both players would follow. In effect, the imbalances act as a roadmap that shows each side what to do. The following list of the imbalances will be discussed all through this book: IN A NUTSHELL An imbalance is any significant difference in the two respective positions. ••� Superior minor piece ••� Pawn structure Space __ ..._ Material Control of a key file __ .... Control of a hole/weak square __ ..._ Lead in development --� Initiative (though I'll usually refer to it as Pushing Your Own Agenda) __ ..._ King safety ••� Statics vs. Dynamics \"Whole sections are devoted to each imbalance on this list, but first let's take a quick, at times exaggerated, look at all of them. My immediate goal is to give you a feel for what imbalances are. My ultimate goal is to train your mind to embrace \"Imbalance Consciousness\" -a state where the use of imbalances be- comes a natural and often unconscious process. Diagram 1 White to move PART ONE I THE CO NCEPT OF IM BALANCES 5 Compare white's Bishop, which is eyeing two position-penetrating diago­ nals, and black's slacker Knight, and you'll immediately know which minor piece is winning this battle. When we add other imbalances into the equa­ tion-White has an advantage in both central and queenside space, a target on a7 (which can be gobbled up by Ra l-bl-b7), and chances to mate (after Bc3 followed by Qd4) black's vulnerable King-one could understand if Black chose this moment to resign. Diagram 2 \\Vhite to move Black's Bishop, which is caged and useless, is no match for white's Knight, which is the ruler of the known universe. Combined with other favorable white imbalances-central, queenside, and kingside space, control of the hole on e6, and (after Ral-bl-b7) pressure against a7 and c7-Black would be well advised to resign as quickly as possible. Pawn Structure - Weak Pawns, Passed Pawns, etc. Diagram 3 \\Vhite to move 6 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Black is a pawn up and he has two passed pawns to white's one passer. Yet, Black can resign! The reason? White's passed pawn is further advanced and all his pieces are working with the pawn to make sure it scores a touchdown on b8: l.b7 (Threatening to win a whole Rook with 2.b8=Q.) l.. .Rh8 2.Bxh8 Rxh8 3.Qc6 Qd8 (No better is 3 ... Qxc6+ 4.Rxc6 Be5 5.Rc8+ Kg7 6.f4 Bd6 7.Rxb8 Bxb8 8.Ral d3 9. KB stopping any d-pawn nonsense and intending Rxa6 fol­ lowed by Ra8) 4.Qc8 Be5 5.Qxd8+ Rxd8 6.Rc8, 1-0. Diagram 4 White to move Black has a weak, isolated pawn on e6. Naturally, White dedicated his game plan to going after it. Thus far, white's Queen and Rooks are piling on the pres­ sure but, since chess is a team game, he's not done yet! l.Bh3 (A fourth white piece enters the assault against e6) l.. .Nd8 2.Ng5 (The entrance of this fifth white piece into the battle for e6 dooms black's pawn.) 2 ... Bh8? (This allows a trick that makes black's game even worse) 3.f5! gxf5 4. Bxf5 and e6 will still fall, but now black's King is sitting in \"open air\" (another imbalance White can use!). Space_:- The Annexation of Terri torr Diagram 5 White to move PART ONE I THE CO NCEPT OF IMB ALANCES 7 A nightmare for Black, who is so cramped that he's gasping for air! �ite has claimed an appreciable advantage in space in virtually every sector. Note how black's lack of wiggle room leaves his pieces in a tight little box, while white's are happy free range pieces. In such positions the side with this much extra space will almost certainly win if he can find a way to break into enemy territory. Here �ite, who enjoys a wealth of riches, can accomplish this by preparing a queenside entry via c4-c5, or a kingside slaughter via g4-g5 (both pawn advances dare to demand even more space!). Thus, logical moves would be l.c5, l.g5, l.Rcgl, or l.Rhl. Diagram 6 White to move �ite is solid, but Black seems to have a nice, active position. If black's c-pawn was on c6 he wouldn't have any problems at all, but it's still on c7 and that gives �ite the chance to embrace his inner greed and claim a material imbalance: l.Bxb7! (Taking this pawn does a number of useful things: It gives �ite \"end­ game odds\"-annoying for Black since the more pieces the materially challenged side trades, the closer to a pawn up endgame victory �ite gets; it creates a hole on c6 which allows �ite to grab control of the central light squares along the hl -a8 diagonal; it places great psychological pressure on Black who now has to get something going in an effort to justify the lost pawn.) l.. .Kh8 (Black would love to take advantage of the errant white Bishop, but nothing works: l.. .c6 2.Qc4+ picks up the c6-pawn; l.. .Bg4 2.Qc4+ [2.8 is also strong] 2 ... Kh8 3.Bc6 [3.Rd4 is a nice alternative] 3 ... Qf5 4.Rd2 intending f2-f4 when Black doesn't have enough compensation for the lost pawn.) and now �ite is very much on top after both 2.Bg2 (A \"reset\" that can be played if�ite suddenly freaks out a bit and decides that his Bishop is too far from home.) and 2.Qc4, making new light-squared inroads. 8 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Control of a K!r£i!� - !loads for Rooks Diagram 7 White to move White is doubled on the e-file (important since it's the only open file on the board), he has more central and queenside space, and his Bishop is the master of the light-squares along the hl -a8 diagonal. Nevertheless, a lot of material has already been exchanged and the presence of Bishops of opposite colors leads one to believe that Black will be able to hold on. On top of all that, Black intends to swap Rooks along the e-file with ... Rde8. Fortunately for White, there's no need to worry since he has l.Bc6! (l ... Qg4 2.Re4), permanently laying claim to the e-file. Now Black has no active plan and he can only sit back and passively wait, hoping that White won't be able to figure out a way to break through. In the position after l.Bc6, both sides are playing for two possible results: Black will either lose or draw, and White will either win or draw. Obviously, nobody would want to be in black's shoes. Control of a Hole/Weak -Homes for Horses Diagram 8 White to Move PART ONE I THE CONCEPT OF IMB ALANCES 9 White enjoys extra space all over the board, but this battle is clearly about the minor pieces: Both have fallen on hard times-black's Bishop is living in the dirt with no hope of improving its lot, while white's Knight dreams of a better home than the hovel on cl. However, unlike the poor Bishop, the Knight doesn't have to stay in the gutter. Two squares (the mansion on d5 and the mega-mansion on e6) beckon, and all White has to do is figure out how to get his horse there. Once you know your destination/goal, it's easy to find the path to it: l.Nd3 (l .Ne2 is also good) followed by 2.Nf4 and 3.Ne6. Once the Knight reaches its dream square, a well-timed g4-g5 advance will finish Black off. !:ead in Develo£�nt - You're Outnumbered! A lead in development is a very dangerous thing, and the developmentally challenged side should do his best to keep things closed until his King gets safely castled and his other pieces find their way into the fray (thereby catching up in development and allowing a fight of equal armies). Opening gambits are based on creating the imbalance of material vs. develop­ ment, and they can give the attacker some quick wins if the opponent foolishly allows the position to open up. l.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 d6 6.Bc4 White has two pieces out to black's one-on top of this, white's other pieces can be developed far faster than black's. It's clear that the second player has to be careful! 6 ... Nf6?! The more prudent 6 ... e6 and 6 ... a6 are fine. 7.e5! Diagram 9 White offers a second pawn so he can rip open the central lines and gobble up the juicy King-treat on e8. 10 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION 7 ... dxe5 Foolishly doing exactly what White wanted him to do. Though 7 . . . Nxe5?? 8.Nxe5 dxe5 9.Bxf7+ allows White to pick up the black Queen, 7 .. . Ng4! refuses to let White completely rip the position open. 8.Qxd8+ Nxd8? 8 ... Kxd8 is a better try. 9. Nb5 Kd7?? It's still a fight after 9 ... Rb8. 10.Nxe5+ Ke8 ll .Nc7 mate. !!!itiative - Calling the Shots I consider the initiative to be a physical manifestation of a psychological battle-both sides champion their view of things in the hope that the opponent will have to eventually forgo his own plans and react to yours. Thus, I usually refer to it as \"Pushing Your Own Agenda\" (presented in Part Four, Macho Chess), since that clarifies what the initiative is and, at the same time, it tells you how to get it! Diagram 10 Black to move White has just played l.Nh4, intending 2.Ng6 (and, once g6 is covered, an eventual Nf5). Other than this obvious threat, White would like to swing his other Knight over to e3 and, from there, to d5. On the other hand, Black would like to take advantage of the somewhat loose Knight on c4 and the undefended pawn on a2. Black can stop the Ng6 threat by l...Kh7 but, by making a purely defensive move, White gets the opportunity to continue to push his agenda by 2.Bxc5 Qxc5 (2 ... Nxc5 3.Ne3 idea Nd5) 3.Ne3 Nb6 (3 .. .Bxa2?? 4.Bh3 and Black PART ONE I THE CONCEPT OF IMB ALANCES 11 is suddenly dead meat !) 4.N d5 ! Bxd 5 (4 ... Nxd5?? 5.exd5 Bxd5 6.Bxd5 Rxd5 7.Qe4+) 5.exd5 Ne7 6.Qe4+ Kh8 7.c4 and White has managed to create some interest­ ing complications. PHILOSOPHY The initiative is a physical manifestation of a psychological battle. Instead of handing White the initiative in this manner, Black should answer l.Nh4 with 1. .. Qf7! when N g6 is stopped and c4 is under attack (it defends and pushes black's agenda at the same time!). Now the e3-square isn't available for White, but a Knight retreat hangs a2. Suddenly, Black is the one dictating the direction of the game and White has to scramble to keep his position together. His choices are all unappetizing: _..,... 2.Rxd7 fails to 2 ... Rxd7 3.Bxc5 Bxc4 4.Qg4 Bxfl 5.Bxfl (5 .Bxf8 Bxg2) 5 ... Rfd8 and Black is two Exchanges up! 2.Bxc5 Bxc4. __ .... 2.Rd5 !? (an imaginative try to infuse some energy into his position and regain the initiative-White is hoping for 2 ... Bxd5 3.exd5 Ne7 4.Nxa5 Bxe3 5.fxe3 Nxd5 6.Nf5) 2 ... b6! ending the nonsense and leaving White in a quandary. __ .... 2.b3 Bxc4 3.bxc4 Bxe3 4.fxe3 and White is left with an exceptionally ugly pawn formation. King Safety - Dragging Down the Enemy Monarch Diagram 11 White to move This isn't a book about attack, but I felt that King safety should be stressed since it's a major factor (imbalance) in many games. In particular, this book will point to an uncastled King as something that should usually be avoided like the 12 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION plague. In the diagrammed position, White has sacrificed a pawn but enjoys a lead in development and a safe King. Black's King, though, is still in the center and White punishes it before it can get castled. l.Nxf7! Kxf7 (Better is l.. .Qc7 but there's really no reason for Black to continue the game after 2.Nxh8) 2.Qxe6+ Kg6 3.Bd3+ Kh5 4.Qh3 mate. The focus in this book won't be on attacking techniques, but rather on recognizing the dangers of a central King-this will allow you to punish this transgression when it occurs in your games, and to avoid falling victim to this \"illness\" yourself. �tati�s vs. Dynamics - The Battle Between Short m }'erm �!!.� !<?\"ng T�rm Im£alances Statics and dynamics occur in every phase of the game. In general, a dynamic plus is something that needs to be used in a reasonably quick manner-either to score a knockout, or to create a long lasting static advantage of your own. A static imbalance gives its owner something that will be around for a long time-it can be part of an opening system (thus appearing in the first ten moves), cause both sides to march to a particular tune in the middlegame, and still be influencing play right into the endgame. Diagram 12 White to move White has an isolated d-pawn. Black views the pawn as a static weakness: quite a few of his pieces can gang up on it, and the fine d5 -square is also a feather in black's cap. White views the pawn as a dynamic strength: it gains central space, controls the two important squares on cS and e5, and allows White (whose extra space makes his pieces more active than their black counterparts) to build up a nasty kingside attack in many lines. Countless world-class players have championed both sides of this position. PART ONE I THE CONCEPT OF IMB ALA NCES 13 In the third edition of How To Reassess Your Chess, I gave a thinking tech­ nique that I had personally found useful over the years. I felt it might prove equally useful for higher-level amateurs who had been struggling to create logi­ cal plans. However, the passage of time (which always brings new experience and insight) drastically changed my view about the practicality of any complex system of planning. My change of heart came about when I corresponded with students and lovers of chess from all over the world who were obsessed with finding plans (or were simply trying to grasp what a plan really was), and as a result hadn't fully integrated the imbalances into their play. By breaking imbal­ ances and plans into two separate things, I had inadvertently caused many hard working students of the game to lose sight of the one goal I had intended to push: master the imbalances. Though I no longer have faith in convoluted planning systems, I have retained the firm belief that fully understanding the imbalances is 100% attainable for players 1400 and up. Note the word \"understanding.\" This book trains you to recognize the imbalances in any board situation, to understand what each imbalance offers, and to know how to make use of it or diffuse it, depending on which side of the imbalance you are sitting on. Once you gain this knowledge and integrate it into your play, you'll find that something surprising happens: the imbalances alone will often \"tell\" you what to do (or, at the very least, give you a firm push in the right direction)! Thus, if you possess a dynamic advantage you will know that your move needs to be dynamic in nature-a quiet positional move most likely won't address the needs of the position. If your opponent has a glaringly weak pawn on an open file, you will know that at some point you will most likely want to go after it by placing your Rooks on that file. If you have a huge advantage in space, you will think twice before trading a bunch of pieces and alleviating some of his cramp. You can call this adherence to the dictates of the imbalances a plan, or simply a logical move or series of moves. The name isn't important-mastering the imbalances is important and makes all this other stuff possible. Need proof? Go back and look at our first twelve examples. These are illustra­ tions of the imbalances and how to use them, but in every case the imbalances presented simple but effective plans (a series of moves-be it two or four or eight or more-that logically makes use of your positive imbalances is indeed a plan). Let's take a look at some games where imbalance­ basics and impressive plans join together as one. IN A NUTSHELL The imbalances alone will lead you to the right move(s) in most positions, or even help you create a detailed plan. 14 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION V. Topalov - K. Sasikiran, Sofia 2007 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5 8.a3 Bd6 9.cxd5 exd5 10.b4 Nbd7 ll.b5 Ne4 12.Bb2 ReS 13 .a4 Re6 14.Ne2 aS Diagram 13 White to move Once you've read this book and fully integrated all its lessons, a glance will give you the following information: --� White has an advantage in queenside space. Black has a potentially weak pawn on c7. --� If Black pushes the c7-pawn to c6 or c5, bxc6 will leave Black with a weak pawn on b6 and a hole on b5. --� Black's d5-pawn is weak since it can't be defended by another pawn. Black's only source of counterplay is on the kingside-his d6-Bishop, e6-Rook, e4-Knight, and Queen are all eyeing that area. Black's b 7-Bishop, which is defending d5, is playing a purely defensive role. Black's dark-squared Bishop is giving firm support to the c7 -pawn while also playing a key role in any kingside attack that he might drum up. --� White's b2-Bishop is inactive. Armed with this imbalance breakdown, it might strike you that exchanging white's worst piece for one of black's best would be a great idea. And so, with no calculation, planning, or further rumination, White could confidently play the move Topalov himself chose. PART ONE I THE CONCEPT OF IMB ALANCES 15 15.Ba3 ! White forces the exchange of his worst piece for the critically important Bishop on d6. 15 ... Rc8 16.Bxd6 cxd6 Of course, 16 ... R:xd6 was possible, but then c7 would be a permanent source of concern. After 16 ... cxd6, that's no longer the case. In addition, the e5-square is also covered (ending all Nf3 -e5-c6 ideas). Of course, 16 ... cxd6 comes with its own baggage: the d5-pawn is weak and will need babysitting for the rest of the game. 17.Rcl Ndf6 18.h3 Diagram 14 Topalov (New In Chess 4, 2007) now said: \"As you can see, all this is not about concrete lines, but about clear positional weaknesses. I knew that it didn't matter how long it would take me, but in the end all the Rooks would be exchanged, further highlighting his structural problems.\" Topalov, one of the greatest attacking players in the world, is making it clear that his course in this game isn't dependent on his personal tastes (i.e., attack), but rather on the dictates of the board (a quiet buildup in accordance with the imbalances). 18 ... Re7 19.Qb3 h6 20.Rxc8 Qxc8 21 .Rcl Rc7 22.Rxc7 Qxc7 23.Qc2 Topalov had this to say in regard to the position that would result after the exchange of Queens: \"I can chase away the Knight on e4, transfer my Bishop to b3 and sooner or later I will exert pressure with two pieces on d5 and push my kingside pawns.\" Okay, there's no getting around it-this is clearly a plan! But did he use any strange \"system\" to create it? No, this too is based on the imbalances: he will chase away black's advanced Knight by f2-f3 (Knights need advanced squares to be effective-thus he intends to turn a good enemy piece into a passive one), 16 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION he'll aim his pieces against the weakness on d5, and then he'll gain space on the kingside by advancing his pawns there (which would give him yet another positive imbalance to work with). 23 ... Qe7 24.Qcl White's Queen already controls the c-file, but now it also defends e3 . This shows white's intention to chase black's one active piece away with an eventual f2-f3 (when the e3 -pawn will be happy to have some support). 24 ... g6 25.Nh2 Kg7 26.h4 This gains kingside space, deprives the e4-Knight of the g5-square, and threatens to win by f3 . 26 ... Ne8 27.f3 N4f6 28.Nfl h5 29.Nf4 Nd7 29 ... Nc7 followed by ... Ne6 was a better setup. 30.Qel Nf8 31 .Qg3 Kh6 32.Nxh5!? 32.Kf2 followed by Nfl -d2-b l-c3 would have continued the grind and main­ tained the pressure. However, Topalov decides to up the ante in his opponent's time pressure. Can Black find all the right defensive moves with his clock rapidly ticking down to nothing? The rest of the game, which has nothing to do with our theme, is given with minimum comments: 32 ... gxh5 (32 ... Kxh5 ?? 33 .Qf4 wins outright) 33.Qg8 f5 (The only move) 34.Ng3 Ng7 35.Bxf5 Ng6 36.Bxg6 Kxg6 37.Nxh5! Qxe3+ 38.Kh2 Qe7?? (Black cracks in time trouble and plays the losing move. Correct was 38 ... Qxd4 when a draw would be the most likely outcome) 39.Nf4+ Kf6 40.g4 Qf7 41.Qd8+ Qe7 42.Qg8 Qf7 43.Qd8+ Qe7 44.Qxe7+ (44.Qxb6 was even stronger) 44 ... Kxe7 45.Kg3 Ne6 46.Nxe6 Kxe6 47.f4 Bc8 48.f5+ Kf7 49.h5 Bd7 50.h6 Kg8 51 .Kf4 Be8 52.Kg5 Kf7 53.h7 Kg7 54.h8=Q+ Kxh8 55.Kf6 Bxb5 56. Ke7 Bd3 57.£6 Bg6 58.f7 Bxf7 59.Kxf7, 1-0. Here's another example of a player finding a logical (and in this case deadly) sequence of moves by the simple act of trying to enhance an already existing imbalance. PART ONE I THE CONCEPT OF IM BALANCES 17 Diagram 15 N. Short - J. Timman, Tilburg 1991 White to move It's clear that White is in complete control of this position-he owns the d-file (thus turning black's Rooks into passive spectators) and his Queen is firmly ensconced on one of black's weakened kingside dark squares. On the other hand, Black can hardly make a move, which means that White doesn't have to fear any incoming fire. If you were to agonize over a plan without consulting the imbalances, you might become frustrated. However, if you merely asked, \"I own the kingside dark squares. What other pieces can penetrate on them?\" then you would be faced with a limited amount of options: l. Kf4! l.N g5 is the obvious candidate-it leaps to a dark square and threatens to chop on f7. Unfortunately, l. .. Qxg2+ would put a damper on white's celebrations. l.Rf4 takes up residence on f4 and intends to follow up with Rxf7, but l.. .Qxd7 would be embarrassing. And this leaves only one other white piece that can drive down the dark-square highway-white's King! But now we suddenly run into our beginner training/conditioning, which tells us to keep the King at home until an endgame is reached. And it's this very fact that makes this game so charming! This move shocks many players, but if you had a Bishop on d2 would you hesitate to play Bh6, which forces mate? Of course not! Then, if it's safe, why not use the King in the same way? 1 .. . Bc8 2.Kg5, 1-0. The threat ofKh6 followed by mate on g7 ends the game. For example, 2 ... Kh7 3.Qxg6+ (or 3. Rxf7+ Rxf7 4.Qxf7+ Kh8 5.Kh6 when white's King finishes up its journey with deadly effect) 3 ... Kh8 4.Qh6+ Kg8 5.Kf6 and mate follows white's total domination of the kingside dark squares. 18 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION PHILOSOPHY Imbalances are the doorway to planning. So was Short's play a plan, or an illustration of the power of \"Imbalance Consciousness?\" Call it anything you like, but pay attention to the thing that allowed you to find the solution: the imbalances! Let's take a moment off from our look at heady concepts and strange new philosophies and have a bit of fun. We're going to look at a game through the eyes of three kinds of players. One (Mr. Metallic) shows us a person who dreams of thinking like a machine. The second is a guy (Mr. Pink) who knows noth­ ing of imbalances, but seeks to live and die by the \"Chess is about material and threats\" mind-stream. Our third (Mr. Orange) is an imbalance aficionado. The first two will team up and take White, the third will handle the Black pieces. Note that the White players will be better at calculation, while Black will have a superior knowledge of opening theory. Mr. Metallic and Mr. Pink vs. Mr. Orange, Fantasyland 2009 Mr. Metallic: Any reasonable move leaves us 0.12 to 0. 18 ahead. I'll go for that 0. 18 figure! Mr. Pink: I want to play l.e4. Does this hang anything? No. So far so good! Are we threatening anything after l.e4? Not yet, but once we get our Bishop and Queen out, we'll shred the sucker! Okay, l.e4 is good! l.e4 Mr. Orange: They gained central space, freed their light-squared Bishop and Queen, and took control over the d5 -square. l.e4 is obviously a good move, but my very strange looking opponents seem to be aggressive sorts so I'll throw a bit of violence back at them and see how they react. l...d5 Mr. Metallic: Ah, an inferior reply. Now we're 0.3 7 up! Victory is almost ours! Mr. Pink: Danger! Danger! Our e-pawn is hanging! Danger! We must take his pawn and, when he recaptures, we'll bring a new attacking piece out and attack his Queen at the same time! Oh yeah, this is going to be good. 2.exd5 Mr. Orange: They played the best reply. I'll develop a piece and take back on d5 with my Knight. I've looked this line over a bit and it's interesting-especially if they don't know what they are doing! 2 ... Nf6 PART ONE I THE CONCEPT OF IM BALANCES 19 Mr. Metallic: I think we can win material! By definition, I will eat everything that's offered. Mr. Pink: He didn't allow 2 ... Qxd5 3.Nc3 when we're attacking his Queen. He would be dead meat then. Now I think we can win a pawn with 3.c4. True, in that case he can attack our Queen with 3 ... Bg4 but we could attack him right back with 4.f3 . Am I good or what? 3.c4 Mr. Orange: The vacant look in their eyes tells me that they don't have a clue. Of course, I can't be sure of that. Perhaps they intend to answer my 3 ... c6 with 4.d4 when we will transpose into the Panov-Botvinnik Variation of the Caro­ Kann. Since I'm mainly a Caro player, I don't mind this at all. 3 ... c6 Mr. Metallic: He's giving us a pawn! We'll have at least a 0.26 plus. Mr. Pink: We can chop on c6 when we're a solid pawn up. What if we take by 4.dxc6 and he attacks us with 4 ... Bg4? We can still attack him back with 5.f3, but ... I see something that's really cool: 5.cxb7!! Bxd l 6.bxa8=Q and it's over! I'm a genius! 4.dxc6 Mr. Orange: Wow! I didn't think they would go for that. I'm now a pawn down but after I recapture with my Knight I'll have a lead in development (which gives me a dynamic plus and chances for attack), control of the hole on d4 (a long-term static advantage), and pressure against white's backward d-pawn (another long-term static plus). 4 ... Nxc6 Diagram 16 Mr. Metallic: A pity! The other recapture gave us at least a 0. 72 advantage. Now he has some play, but a pawn is a pawn, so we should be happy. 20 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Mr. Pink: So we're already a pawn up. Does he have any threats? Just ... Bg4, but we can answer it with Nf3 or Be2 or f3 or just about anything. All we need to do now is get our guys out, castle, and our extra pawn will win in the end­ game-isn't that what the grandmasters always do? 5.Nc3 Mr. Orange: I own d4, but I would like to increase my control over that square again. I also need to develop my dark-squared Bishop and castle. 5 ... e5 seems to address all these issues. Of course, ... e5 does weaken the d5-square, but he's so far behind in development that there's no way for him to take advantage of d5 for a long time to come. 5 ... e5 Mr. Metallic: 0.09. We're still in charge and we're still a pawn ahead. Mr. Pink: He intends to answer 6.Nf3 with 6 ... e4, attacking our Knight. Fortunately, we should play 6.d3 when his pawn advance is stopped. Then we can follow with Nf3 , Be2, 0-0, and we're on our way to glory. 6.d3 Mr. Orange: Okay, I have all sorts of good positional options and I'm a bit confused. 6 ... Bb4 and 6 ... Bc5 both look promising, though I don't really want to chop on c3 (after 6 ... Bb4) since after bxc3 he would suddenly cover the d4-hole. I'll try 6 ... Bf5 since that targets his weakness on d3 while also preparing the well-timed dynamic thrust ... e5-e4 if the situation calls for it. 6 ... Bf5 also gives me ... Qd7 followed by ... 0-0-0 when I'm really piling up on d3 ! 6 ... Bf5 Mr. Metallic: 0.26 up and an extra pawn-it still looks nice for us. Mr. Pink: Can we make any threats? 7 .Qf3 hits his Bishop but 7 ... Nd4 defends it, attacks our Queen, and threatens ... Nc2+. No, we can't do that! We'll just continue our plan-develop, castle, and slide into a pawn up endgame victory. After 7.Nf3 we don't have to worry about 7 ... e4 since he would be helping us reach that pawn up endgame. 7.Nf3 Mr. Orange: It's hard to go wrong here. I can play 7 ... Qd7 followed by 8 ... 0-0-0 and snip off d3, but that gives him time to castle. I really like the fact that his King is sitting in the middle, so I'll play more aggressively. 7 ... Bb4 is very tempting since it makes ... e5-e4 even stronger. But 7 ... e4 also looks good, and it forces him to take a path of my choosing. There's just one problem: what happens after 7 ... e4 8.Nh4? How about 8 ... Bg4 9.f3 exf3 10.Nxf3 Bc5 and if i can castle, his Swiss cheese position should allow me to wipe him out. ------------------------------------ PART ONE I THE CONCEPT OF IM BALANCES 21 7 ... e4 Mr. Metallic: White remains 0. 17 ahead with 8.Nh4. Let's do it! Besides, I think we're doing well after 8.Nh4 Bg4 9.8 exf3 10.Nxf3 Bc5 11 .Qe2+! Mr. Pink: 8.Nh4 does attack his Bishop, but after 8 ... Bg4 he just attacks us back. Besides, aren't Knights on the rim supposed to be grim? Or was that dim? Well, in any event I don't like it at all. And your 8.Nh4 Bg4 9.f3 exf3 10.Nxf3 Bc5 11 .Qe2+ runs into 11 .. .Kd7! when his threat of ... Re8 scares me to death. Let's just take on e4 and go into a pawn up endgame. Mr. Metallic: But, I see lots of other variations after 11 ... Kd7. Let me show you! Mr. Pink: No. We're playing 8.dxe4 and that's that. 8.dxe4 Mr. Orange: I can take on e4 or take on d 1. Both look good since any opening of the position has to favor my lead in development. I'll take on e4 and see if he wants to capture on d8 and bring my Rook into play. 8 .. . Nxe4 Mr. Metallic: Let's play 9.Be3 Bb4 10.Qb3 Qf6 11.Rcl Bh3 12.Qc2 Bf5 13 .Bd3 Nxc3 14.bxc3 Qxc3+ 15 .Qxc3 Bxd3 16.Nd4 0-0-0 17.Nxc6 Bxc3 + 18.Rxc3 bxc6 19.f3 (1 9.Bxa7 Rhe8+ 20.Be3 Re4 21 .Kd2 Bxc4+ is 0.00) 19 ... Rd7 20.Kf2, 0.22 up for us! Mr. Pink: Say what? I didn't understand any of those moves. It all looks insane. Who would play a move like 11 ... Bh3 , and even if the line you gave did occur, the opposite colored Bishops make it a dead draw. You're starting to freak me out, Mr. Metallic! Instead of that garbage, let's just play 9.Be2 and try to castle! 9.Be2 Mr. Orange: He's going to castle. I have to play with as much energy as pos­ sible or he'll get his house in order. 9 ... Bb4, developing with threats, has to be right since 10.Qb3 runs into 10 ... Nc5. 9 ... Bb4 Diagram 17 22 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Mr. Metallic: 10.Qb3 Nc5 11 .Qd1 Bxc3+ 12 .bxc3 Qxd 1+ (12 ... Qa5 !?) 13 .Bxd1 0-0-0 is -0. 34 so we can't do that! We have to play 10.Bd2 . Mr. Pink: Why would we move our Queen to b3 and then back to d 1? You're spouting gibberish! 10.Bd2 is clearly the way to go. 10.Bd2 Mr. Orange: He threatens to trade a lot of stuff off so I'll capture on d2 and leave him in a nasty pin. 10 ... Nxd2. We'll end our three-way battle here. After 11.Nxd2 (1 1 .Qxd2 Qxd2 + 12 .Nxd2 Nd4 13.Bd1 0-0-0 14.0-0 Rhe8 is miserable for White since all his pieces are bad, and ... Bd3 is a strong threat. However, 14.Nfl ! is a better defense.) 11.. .Nd4 12.Rcl (12 .0-0 Bc2 13.Qe1 0-0 and white's in bad shape) 12 ... 0-0 13.Nfl (1 3 .0-0 loses the Exchange to 13.. .Nxe2+ 14.Qxe2 Bd3) 13 ...

Qf6 was very strong: 16.0-0 (1 6.Nd5 Rxd5 17.cxd5 ReS) 16 .. . Nxe2+ 17.Qxe2 Bd3 winning material. What was the point of this example? These color-coded players are represen­ tations of three real human types: Mr. Metallic In an age where every serious player has a powerful chess engine, I've watched a chess pandemic appear that's unlike anything that's ever been seen before: While following live grandmaster games, the masses of chess fans all suffer from a shared chess psychosis-they think they know exactly what's going on. Topalov plays some extremely complex move and thousands write in eerie unison, \"Topalov is 1.02 up! He's going to win!\" They are parroting their engine's assessment, but they seem to mistake it for their own. They stare at their machine's rapid-fire burst of moves, but do they understand why it's recommending them? One might think that a chess player would see beyond the illusion and not confuse his own strengths with those of his computer. Sadly, this is often not the case. And this same \"illness\" carries over to postal chess and analysis. Of course, once these computer-enhanced fans take part in an over-the-board tournament, their false reality quickly crashes and burns. But they can also be brought down to Earth by a few words from a good chess teacher. All he needs to ask (once an interesting position appears) is, \"What's going on here?\" And suddenly an honest student will realize that he's deceived himself! Since he hasn't mastered the imbalances, he can't answer the question in any deep and penetrat­ ing manner. And telling the teacher that so-and-so is 0.43 ahead borders on the ---------------------------------- PART ONE I THE CONCEPT OF IMB ALANCES 23 insane. A chess engine can be very useful, but it can also turn into a crutch that actually prevents you from improving. Mr. Metallic was created to show how nobody thinks like a computer, nor would we want to. Chess is a game rich in emotion, art, the rush of competition, and the joy of creation. Streams of variations and displayed numbers (0.21) turn a warm, extremely human game into something cold and unknowable. Mr. Pink When you don't have a grasp of the imbalances, you're left with absolutely nothing, or (as in the case of Mr. Pink) with caveman basics like attack, defend, threats, and calculation. These are good things-everyone needs them. But is this simplistic ABC approach all you want for yourself? Mr. Orange Though Mr. Orange couldn't calculate quite as deeply as his opponents, he saw far more than either of his foes. The imbalances gave him a well-rounded positional education that offered him a solid understanding of both quiet static positions and sharper dynamic ones. Go back and look at all the comments. It's clear that Mr. Orange was the only one that had any idea about the position's secrets and ultimate worth. Now we turn to you, the reader of this book. You might not calculate very well, or you might calculate better than Mr. Orange (it's always a good thing if you have the ability to calculate quickly and deeply, but knowledge of the imbalances will often get you by even if your absolute limit is a two-or-three move sequence), but wouldn't you rather be in Mr. Orange's shoes? If so, you're on your way to acquiring the knowledge that most players (for reasons that elude me) simply don't have. PHILOSOPHY A chess engine can be very useful, but it can also turn into a crutch that actually prevents you from improving. Talk to the Board and It Will Talk to You Everyone has some sort of internal dialogue when it's their turn to move. Most players stare blankly at the board and think, \"I go there and he goes there and I go there and he goes there!\" It's pure calculation, usually based on fear, aggression, or simply the desire to find something-anything-that 24 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION seems reasonable. However, if I stopped you from calculating and asked, \"Can you verbally break this position down for me?\" the odds are that your answer wouldn't be lecture-worthy. Make no mistake about this: at any given moment, you should be able to lecture other players about the pros and cons of any position you reach! And, if you can't put your thumb on the pulse of the position, if you don't know what both sides need to accomplish, then how are you going to find the right move? It's like asking for driving directions to an unknown place. This is why most players feel lost at sea. They feel they don't know what's going on, and so try to patch up the cracks by looking for threats and/or looking for ways to create them. They know something's wrong-something's missing. But they don't know what to do about it, and this creates a feeling of powerlessness. Trust me when I tell you that it doesn't have to be this way. It's time to get a bit crazy-once you master the imbalances (and if you read this book from beginning to end, you will master the imbalances!), it will be time to get up close and personal with the board. In general, you can figure out a good deal about any position by doing the following: First up is the Armageddon Discourse: Make sure you are aware of any crude threats by the opponent, and also do a quick search for any basic tactical themes that might be present. This is usually done subconsciously by players 1800 and up. However, if you are lower rated, are prone to blunders, or feel that you have serious tactical issues, then it's a good idea to take a few moments to get on top of this stuff. Once you've made sure that Thor's hammer isn't going to descend on your head, it's time for loftier considerations. ••..,.. Ascertain the imbalances for both sides. ••..,.. Then ask the board (in an internal dialogue), \"What move or series of moves tries to take advantage of these factors?\" Pretty simple! Let me stress once again that you should not be after plans per se (don't allow yourself to get distracted by the \"P\" word), but rather moves that cater to the imbalances. As we've seen, when you do this, plans often seem to materialize by themselves. Let's see how the imbalances can dictate the course that both players take in a game. G. Kamsky - V.

Time to tighten up and make a draw.\" Indeed, the game ended in a draw in 43 moves. Note how all the ruminations were centered on the imbalances, and all the variations were also dedicated to the imbalances. This kind of logical breakdown of a position works for grand­ masters and it will work for you too! Our next example demonstrates how basic imbalance dialogue can even help solve double-edged, complicated positions. Diagram 19 L.V. Nisipeanu - V. Milov, Warsaw 2005 White to move PART ONE I THE CONCEPT OF IM BALANCES 27 The position is quite sharp. White could focus on thoughts of the potentially weak pawns on a6, c5, e4, f2 , and h2, but he knows from experience that such a dynamic position calls for a dynamic solution (we will discuss Statics vs. Dy­ namics in Part Six). Several things must have caught white's eye: the Knight is pinned, if the Bishop wasn't on h6, Qh8+ would win, if Qf6 was possible, that would win the Knight, and if d5 -d6 could be played, that would open the a2 -g8 diagonal for white's light-squared Bishop-a fact that might well increase the power of an attack against black's King. If we look for a move that addresses all these factors, it would be 1.Bf4, but that loses to l. ..Qxf4 2.Qh8+ Ke7 3.Qxg7 Qxf2+. So Bf4 would be ideal if it couldn't be taken. Many players would just give up on it and play something like l.Bg5, which also embraces some of the points we discussed-l .. .Kg8 allows White to unleash the passed d-pawn by 2.Be7, and l. .. Qxh2 loses outright to 2.Qxh2 Bxh2 3.Rh1 when a retreat by black's Bishop allows a landing on h8. Thus, after 1.Bg5 Black pretty much has to block the h-file with 1 ... Nh5 when 2.Qxe4 is obviously good for White, but one gets the impression that he should have been able to do much better. In the game, White knew that Bf4 was ideal but not immediately possible, but instead of saying, \"I can't\", he went out of his way to find a move that would make Bf4 a reality. l.Rg4! Winning. 2 .Bf4 is threatened and Black has no good way to deal with it. l. . .Qxh2 Discouraged, Black goes down right away. However, there wasn't a defense: l.. .Qb6 loses to both 2.d6 Qxd6 (2 ... Bxd6 3.Qf6) 3.Bf4 and 2.Rxe4 Kg8 3.d6 Qxd6 4.Bf4. Perhaps 1 ... Kg8 was best, but then 2.Bf4 Qd7 3.Bxc7 Qxc7 4.Rxg6 is pretty grim. 2.Qf6, 1-0. Black had no desire to see 2 ... Be5 3.Bxg7+ or 2 ... Qxh6 3.d6. There will be much more on this kind of \"I want to do it and I will find a way! \" mentality in Part Four, Psychological Meanderings. You now know what an imbalance is. You know that imbalances can help you figure out what's going on in most positions.

Summary Bishops - Tests Bishops vs. Knights / Feeling the At times, Knights-also known as nerts, neons, jumpers, octopus, squid, and horses-are very much like clowns. They leap over other pieces, they prance about in a strange drunken gait, their movements make them seem almost alien compared to the other chessmen, and they can even make us laugh when we see a Knight do an octopus imitation by forking the whole royal family and estate (attacking King, Queen, and both country homes/Rooks all at once). However, as any clown-wise child will tell you, there is also something scary about them. They seem docile, but behind the facade and horse-like grin is a psychopath, and nothing is safe. Diagram 20 Black to move I was watching a student of mine play random 1-minute games on the ICC (Internet Chess Club) and expected him (he was Black) to resign here. Instead, I was witness to something that seemed more like a tragicomedy (or an episode of the Simpsons) than a chess game: 63 ... Nf2 64.Be2 Nxg4 65.a6 \"Okay\" I thought, \"it's over. Time for Black to give up.\" Of course, I couldn't have guessed that black's Knight was really some sort of ravenous demon in disguise, ready to go on a binge and devour everything in sight. 65 ...

An epic tragedy for White, but Black had to be rather pleased with himself! I can imagine many of you telling me, \"Who cares? White went crazy and gave everything away_ Surely a really good player wouldn't fall victim to such foolishness?\" One would think so, but let's take a look at a game of the 15th World Chess Champion, Vishy Anand. You'd consider him a \"really good player,\" wouldn't you? V. Anand - V. lvanchuk, World Blitz Moscow 2007 l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.Bd3 Bc5 6.Nb3 Ba7 7.Qe2 Nc6 8.Be3 d6 9.Nld2 Nf6 10.f4 0-0 ll.Bxa7 Rxa7 12.g4 b5 13.0-0-0 Rc7 14.Rhgl Qe7 15.Kbl Nd7 16.g5 Bb7 17.Rg3 Nb4 18.Rh3 g6 19.Qg4 Rfc8 20.Qh4 Nf8 21 .a3 Nxd3 22.cxd3 h5 23.gxh6 Qxh4 24.Rxh4 Nh7 25.Nd4 Nf6 26.N2£3 ReS 27.Ng5 e5 28.fxe5 dxe5 Diagram 21 White to move This was the final game of the event, and would determine who would earn the title of World Blitz Champion. In other words, they had to play quickly but it was serious business! Anand had outplayed his opponent and now had a forced win. 29.Ndf3 ?? The god of Knights wasn't kind to Anand in this game. He missed 29.h7+ Kg7 (29 ... Kh8 30.Rfl is easy) 30.Nde6+! (It's always a scary thing when ani­ mals attack.) 30 ... fxe6 3l .Nxe6+ Kh8 (3 1.. .Rxe6 allows 32.h8=Q+) 32 .Nxc7 . This would have been rather nice, but having overlooked the possibility and PART TW O I MINOR PIECES 33 granting Black a reprieve, the lone enemy Knight suddenly takes matters into its own hands/hoofs. 29 ...

This Knight gets uppity and destroys the f4-Knight's defender. 33 ... Ne2 Argh! Suddenly the e5-Knight and the g 1-Rook are both hanging at the same time. 34.Rel Nd4 Black's Knight shows no mercy. Now e5 is still hanging, so White moves it to safety. To be fair, White no longer had a satisfactory reply-the black Knight had already injected its venom into the white position and, as everyone knows, there is no antidote for a horse bite. 35.Neg4 35 .Nfg4 Bxg4 36.Nxg6+ fxg6 37.Rxg4 Kh7 was a better shot, but also pretty depressing. 35 ... Nf3 Diagram 22 34 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION DOH! Yes, it even happens to World Champions. Both Rooks are forked, and there's nothing that can be done about it! 36.Nf6 Rd8 Moving his Rook to safety. The black fork against el and h4 isn't going away. 37.Nd5 Rb7, 0- 1. White will now lose a full Rook. HI was Ivanchuk, I would have taken that Knight home, framed it, and placed it on the wall so I could give it a loving look every day for the rest of my life. These two games have a moral: Knights are very tricky pieces and are fully capable of inflicting untold damage on the enemy position. In fact, if you come There's a reason why many amateurs fear Knights-they are very tricky and deserve your full respect! '� across some book that's trying to convince you that Bishops are a tad more valuable, spit on it and remember what hap- pened to poor Anand! Now that I've trained you to see Knights as the fearsome creatures they really are, let's deconstruct them and see what makes them tick and what makes them sick (and, since Bishops and Knights are always at each other's throats, we'll do an occasional comparison between the two): Knights are minor pieces (along with Bishops), and are generally given a point-count value of 3 (the same as Bishops). ••..,_ Minor pieces are an imbalance unto themselves; knowing how to use them properly gives you a huge advantage over the competition. Knights are the best blockaders of enemy passed pawns. The reason for this is simple: Unlike other pieces, a Knight that's sitting in front of an enemy pawn isn't losing any of its mobility. Advantage Knight! See diagram 23 for an illustration. Knights are short-range pieces. Unlike Bishops, which can slide the length of the board in a single move, Knights are more \"restrained\". Advantage Bishop! See diagram 24 for an illustration. ••..,_ Knights can jump over other pieces. There isn't anything else that can do this (Okay, my cat can do it, but he doesn't count!). Advantage Knight! --.... Knights have the potential to attack or defend anything on any colored square-it might take several moves, but eventually PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 35 they will get there. Bishops are always stuck on one color. Advantage Knight! Knights do quite well in closed positions because, unlike Bishops, pawns can't block them. Advantage Knight! See diagram 2 5 for an illustration. Knights crave advanced support points (i.e., a safe square that can't easily be challenged by a hostile pawn). Since they are short-range pieces, having access to such a square is a huge part of proper Knight strategy. Knights gain in strength as they move further up the board. As a rule of thumb: • A Knight stuck on the 1st or 2nd ranks is a defensive piece and is inferior to a healthy Bishop (a diseased Bishop is quite another matter). • A Knight on the 3rd rank is a flexible workhorse and can be used for defense or attack at a moment's notice. A Knight on the 3rd often has serious central influence. See diagram 26 for an illustration. • A Knight on a 4th rank support point is a very strong, flexible piece. You can count on it to ably perform both defensive and offensive duties. See diagram 27 for an illustration. • A Knight on a 5th rank support point can be a beautiful thing to behold. It's a potent offensive weapon and is usually superior to a Bishop. See diagram 28 for an illustration. • A Knight on a 6th rank support point can make children weep and women cry for joy. Here a Knight transforms from horse to Octopus, its many appendages spiking out in all directions and claiming enemy territory as its own. Such a Knight is, at times, stronger than a Rook. See diagram 29 for an illustration. • A Knight on the 7th and 8th ranks gives us a case of diminishing returns. Once past the 6th, it no longer controls as many squares since its reach runs out of board. Usually a Knight on such an advanced rank is performing some sort of tactical or search and destroy operation. 36 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 23 White to move Knight as ultimate blockader This position is a graphic illustration of the difference between a blockading Knight and a blockading Bishop. White's Knight is firmly blocking the passed f-pawn, but it's still a potent attacker thanks to its ability to jump over other pieces. In this case both e6 and g6 are under the gun. In comparison, the Bishop is purely defensive. Since white's King is free to roam (and black's clearly isn't), the game is easily won: l.Kh4 Be8 2.Ka5 Ke7 3.Kh6 Kd7 4.Kh7 followed by c6 when it's all over. Diagram 24 The Bishop is the King of distance It will take the Knight a minimum of four moves to attack the distant pawn on a6 (for example, N g4, N e5, N d3 , N c5). However, the Bishop needs just one move to threaten that pawn (Be2 or Bb7). PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 37 Diagram 25 Black to move Knights are masters of closed positions Knights can attack both light and dark squares White's Knight threatens to go to d3 and then chop on c5. Black's Bishop is very unhappy in this closed position and can't do anything to prevent this, which means he's dead lost. If Black gets desperate and gives the horrible l. ..a5 2.Nd3 a4 3.bxa4 Bd7 a go, then 4.Nxc5 (yes, 4.a5 is also game over) captures the pawn (which stood on a dark square), hits the enemy Bishop (on a light square), and defends the a4-pawn (also on a light square) all at the same time. Diagram 26 White to move Knights on the 1st and 3rd ranks Black has two Bishops, but White has a lead in development and more central space. The Knight on f1 is giving h2 firm support (It's hardly a world beater on that square, but it's serving an important defensive function), while the Knight on c3 puts pressure on d5 and gives support to l.e4, which adds to white's space and increases the pressure against d5. 38 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 27 Knight on the 4th rank The white Knight is an imposing piece. Aside from defending several squares on the 2nd and 3rd ranks, Black must constantly worry about it leaping to b5, c6, e6, or fS . On top of all that, the Knight is firmly blocking black's isolated d-pawn and, if it so chooses, can step back and take part in a direct assault against d5 via Ne2, Rd4, Qd2 , and Nf4 with enormous pressure against black's position. Diagram 28 Knight on the 5th rank White's dynamic Knight is running rings around black's defensive steed. The e5-Knight is on a permanent support point and is eyeing c6, d7, f7 and g6-all spots deep in enemy territory. Note that black's Knight can't make a home on d5 since c3 -c4 would chase it away. PART TWO I MINOR PIE CES 39 Diagram 29 Knight on the 6th rank This position is completely hopeless for Black. White's Knight is a monster, while black's Bishop is pathetic. Note that the Knight is battering away at several squares deep in black's camp. Though it's clear that it would control less squares on the 7th or 8th ranks, the Knight might leap there if it led to material gain or achieved some other kind of dynamic function. White has a couple of devastating plans here. One is Ra3 followed by Rda l, Qa2 , axb5, and then a decisive penetration down the a-file. Another idea is Ne4-f6 (a new 6th rank post!), Rd6, etc. Because Knights are short-range pieces, you need to calmly march them to the desired post. This might take two or three moves, but it's something that needs to be done. Some players have a problem with this because they think it takes too much time, and it is indeed a bad idea if pieces are whizzing back and forth in some form of tactical mortal combat where time is more important than life itself. However, most positions don't exist in this state of frenzy, and building up your game (developing, creating a nice pawn center, putting pressure to bear against weak enemy pawns, etc.) is usually the way to go. Diagram 30 I. Nepomniachtchi - S. Brynell, Wijk aan Zee C 2007 White to move 40 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N White clearly has a nice attacking position, while Black doesn't seem to have anything going for him at all (where is his counterplay?). In the actual game, White got a little excited and tried for instant gratification with l.Bcl (threat­ ening 2.f5) l.. .Rh8 2.Rg4 but after 2 ... Ng7 Black was holding tight. Instead, he should have improved the position of his Knight, which isn't helping its teammates on e2 . Where should this Knight go? How about e4? That looks like a very nice support point, and from that square it lashes out at d6, f6, and g5 (then any move by the e8-Knight would be crushed by Nf6+). Since we know that the Knight's position should be improved, and since we know that e4 is the Promised Land, the only question that remains is \"how do we get it there?\" The answer doesn't call for any calculation at all: l.Nc3 with Ne4 to follow. For ·� those wondering what happens if Black PHILOSOPHY whacks the Knight off after l.Nc3 Bb7 Chess is a team game. If possible, make sure 2.Ne4 Bxe4 3.dxe4 Rg8, Black would find himself under serious kingside pressure after 4.f5 (made possible by the d3 -pawn being moved to e4). every piece joins in the battle! Each piece you own should be treated with parental care. If your Bishop is hitting a brick wall, find (or create) a diagonal for the poor thing! If your Knight is sitting around like a couch potato, drag it to an embattled sector and put the lazy thing to work! l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 a6 8.a3 cxd4 9.Nxd4 Bc5 10.Be2 0-0 ll.Qd2 Qc7 12 .Bf3 Nxd4 13 .Bxd4 Nb6 14.Ne2 Bxd4 15.Qxd4 Bd7 16.b3 Bb5 17.Nc3 Rfc8 18.Nxb5 axb5 19.Be2 Diagram 31 V. Topalov - V. Ivanchuk, MTel 2008 Black to move This position is better for Black, but that assessment might prove somewhat surprising for those players who noticed the active Bishop on e2 , the weak PAR T TWO I MINOR PIE CES 41 doubled-isolated pawn on bS, and white's central and kingside space advantage. However, Black's not without his own perks. After all, he does have a queenside spatial plus and white's pawns on a3 and c2 are both weak and under pressure. So why doesn't the black position inspire confidence? The Knight! It's hor­ rible, and the superiority of white's Bishop doesn't seem in question. A look at that Knight might well make us accept this point of view; after all, the Knight's forcing its Queen to do babysitting duty. And where is the thing going to go? Both a4 and c4 are poison, and blah, that blasted stupid Knight blah, rave, finger wagging, blah! I added the \"blahs\" since anyone can whine about a problem, but few actually do anything to rectify the situation. It's clear that the Knight is a goat, but if you're Black, then it's your goat and it's your responsibility to improve its lot. A solution can be found only when you make the psychological transition from \"I'm doomed! \" to \"I must fix this!\" And sure enough, knowing that the Knight has no future on b6 (mixed with a positive mental outlook) makes the solution rather easy to find! 19 ... Nd7! The only Knight-move that doesn't give away a piece! Now the Knight is no longer being eyed by the white Queen, and this means that black's lady is sud­ denly free to feast! 20 ...

I was looking at this game with a friend of mine (an IM) and, at this point, he blurted out, \"Whose minor piece is better PHILOSOPHY If one of your minor pieces isn't earning its keep, put the lazy thing to work! In the case of a Knight, wishful thinking won't get it to that dream post-it's up to you figure out a way to get it there. ··� now? Huh? Whose? \" The Knight, which once sat on the pa­ thetic b6-square, has made a remarkable metamorphosis. You should now know Knight-basics, and you should be aware that if your Knight isn't taking part in the battle, you have to somehow make it take part! This isn't easy, but it all starts from the awareness that, 1) There's a problem; and 2) Once you address the problem, you must insist on solving it. We're talking about mixing knowledge, a sharp awareness of the imbalances, and willpower to raise your game to a higher level. Our next example (diagram 32) is a nice demonstration of this process: knowledge tells you that Knights are strong on advanced squares (the 5th and 6th ranks being the most desirable). Awareness leads you to the fact that c6 would be a hole if Black no longer had his light-squared Bishop to defend it, and that a Knight on fS would also be a feather in your cap. Willpower is the thing that allows you to insist on turning these elements into some form of positive reality. M. Roiz - C. Balogh, Heraklion 2007 l.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 d5 3.Bg2 e6 4.0-0 Nbd7 5.d3 b6 6.c4 Bh7 7.cxd5 exd5 8.Nc3 Be7 9.e4! dxe4 10.dxe4 Nc5 Diagram 32 White to move PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 43 White has a central pawn majority and the e-pawn gives him a central space advantage. Black's King isn't castled yet, which gives White some options that a castled King wouldn't offer him (for example, Black won't want to start a fight until he gets his King to safety). Earlier I mentioned the potential hole on c6 and the nice outpost on f5. With all this information in mind, white's next move should make perfect sense. 11 .Nd4! White instantly targets both c6 and f5 . 11.. .0-0 11 ... Nfxe4? is suicide since this capture opens a road right to the uncastled black King: 12 .Nxe4 Bxe4 (12 ...

To do so, you'll need to know the follow­ ing formula: Anti-Knight Strategy: Knights lose a lot of their pop if you can take away (or deprive them of access to) all their advanced support points. 44 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 33 J. Silman - F.R. (1 539), Los Angeles training game 2004 White to move I used this position quite often during lessons with various students, explain­ ing the problems Black faces, letting the student try the White side against me, and then me playing it against the student. One key point is the two holes on f5 and f4. White would love to eventu­ ally post a Knight on f5 while Black wouldn't mind smashing a Knight onto f4. While White has no problem reaching f5 (from e3 or g3), Black can't get to f4 since both e6 and g6 (the black Knight's jump-off points) are poison. Of course, White doesn't have to be in a rush to play Ng3 -f5 since that would allow Black to swap it off. Due to this, White will only go there when he can stay-for example, in many endgames where various pieces have been traded, a Knight ·� . landing safely on f5 might RULE J win one of the pawns on d6 A hole isn't a problem if the enemy pieces can't reach it. and h6 or, at the very least, force Black to assign those pawns a defender. Other problems Black faces in diagram 33: His dark-squared Bishop is an ugly, ineffective piece. Black has less space in virtually every sector of the board. The only area that can be opened and allow major piece penetration is the queenside, and it's clear that White already has all the play there. Note that White moved his \"bad\" Bishop to a4 to get it outside the pawn chain. This means that the Bishop will be active on this square or will be exchanged for black's light-squared Bishop-a Bishop that is one of the defenders of f5 . l.Rb3 Since White isn't worried about ... cxb4, he decides to retain the pawn tension and triple on the b-file before opening it. l ...

This may shock you, but the mighty steeds you've been studying in this chapter also have their own downside (other than being short range pieces, which we've already addressed): they can be dominated! The most humiliating form of Knight domination is caused by its mortal enemy, the Bishop. Diagram 34 White to move 46 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION White's only hope of winning the game is to promote his pawn. This doesn't seem likely because l.a5 Nc6 2.a6 K£6 3.Bd5 Na7 stops the pawn in its tracks. Okay, that Knight is clearly an enemy of the state, so why not put it in prison? l.Bd5! The Knight is completely dominated. The b7- c6- and e6-squares are off limits, while l...Nf7 2.Bxf7 promotes the pawn. l. ..Kf6 The King tries to come to the rescue. 2.a5 Ke5 2 ...

Another form of Knight domination is the dreaded \"entombed piece.\" This is a situation where a Knight (or Bishop!) is stuck in a cage of pawns. Diagram 35 Black to move l. . .g4 This creates an obvious attack on the 8-Knight. That should be easy to deal with, but it turns out to be a clean winner for Black. 2.Ngl Since e5 and g5 are off limits, that only leaves this retreat to gl or the material losing hop to h4: 2 .Nh4 Bxh4 3 .gxh4 Qxh4 with an extra pawn and a strong attack. 2 .. .. f3! and the tomb has been shut and sealed. Now the Knight can't ever safely move again, while its King is also in the same tiny cell. Black is now, in effect, a piece up (in fact, two pieces up since the white King is sharing the same fate as the horse) and should easily win the game. In the last example we saw a Knight locked into a tomb by enemy pawns. It's even worse if the Knight's own pawns trap it! PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 47 Diagram 36 White to move The position in diagram 36 is nothing sort of comic.

The most common kind of Knight domination (though not nearly as apoca­ lyptic as the previous two) is caused by those annoying enemy pawns, which can take control of key jump off points and/or landing strips (open squares) and leave the Knight with nowhere to go and nothing to do.

However, the other black Knight on b 7 has high hopes of living large on cS. Once there, if White chases it with the b-pawn the Knight could chop on d3 or leap onto a4. Once again, a little pawn will dominate a big, powerful horse via 26.b4! when the once hopeful b 7-Knight has no future at all on the queenside (in fact, it eventually migrated to the kingside by ... Nb7-d8, ... f7-f6, and ... Nf7). As you can see, using pawns to limit the activity of enemy Knights is a very important strategic idea-get used to employing it and watch the opponent's Knights whither and die! Finally it's time to address my favorite Knight maneuver: the artistic but poisonous step-back boogie! J. Silman - M. Montchalin, Richland 1985 l.d4 Nf6 2.NB c5 3.d5 d6 4.Nc3 g6 5.e4 Bg7 6.Bh5+ Nbd7 7.a4 0-0 8.0-0 a6 9.Be2 b6 10.Re1 Ne8 11 .Bf4 Qc7 12.Qd2 Ne5 13 .Nxe5 dxe5 14.Bh6 Qd6 15 .Bxg7 Kxg7 Diagram 38 White to move White notices that potential weaknesses lie on b6, cS, and e5. No, cS isn't a typo-the seemingly solid c5-pawn can become loose after a well-timed a4-a5 push undermines its defender on b6. Of course, both b6 and e5 might become tender if White could bring pieces to bear on them, but how can this be done? Let me remind you of our earlier philosophical chess thought: Chess mastery is a mixture of knowledge, awareness, and willpower. This is yet another ex­ ample of that motto. White knows (i.e., has the knowledge based on often-seen patterns) that this kind of pawn structure can lead to difficulties for Black. He's aware that the aforementioned pawns could become weak if there was some way to get his pieces within striking range. And finally, he wants to find a maximum piece setup that will accomplish these goals. PART TW O I MINOR PIECES 49 So what pieces in the White army will be able to exert pressure against the designated targets? Clearly the Bishop can't since it's a light-squared Bishop and the pawns lay on dark squares. The Knight, though, would be a tower of strength on c4 where it would kick the enemy Queen and take direct aim at both b6 and e5. White's Queen can also join the party on e3 (hitting c5 in anticipation of the a4-a5 break and also giving e4 some support), while placing it on c3 seems even better since it eyes both c5 and e5. That leaves the a4-pawn with its a4-a5 aspirations and the f2-pawn with its dreams of f2-f4. So how can White create such a position? This calls for the step-back boogie! 16.Nbl!! A shocking move that is very anti-intuitive, but also very logical. The Knight returns to its beginning square because it just wasn't happy on c3 ! Remember that a piece is only happy if it's on a square where it helps with the overall game plan. In this case the c3 -Knight might look okay on c3 , but it's not addressing all the issues that were discussed earlier. However, wouldn't it be a killer on c4? And suddenly one sees that this odd retreat ties everything together: c3 is now clear for white's Queen while the Knight will head for c4 via a3 or d2 . 16 ... Qf6 This allows White to make his vision a reality. Instead, moves such as 16 ... Bd7 or 16 ... Bb7 would limit white's advantage. Another possibility is 16 ... Nf6 when aside from 17.Qe3, interesting is 17.Na3 !? Nxe4 18.Qe3 Nf6 19.Nc4 Nxd5 20.Nxd6 Nxe3 21 .Nxc8 Nxc2 22 .Nxb6 Ra7 23.a5 with a pleasant edge for White (Black, after he chops one of the Rooks, has a Rook and two pawns for two minor pieces, but the two minors will be very nicely placed while the pawns on a6 and c5 will prove to be extremely weak). 17.Qc3 Nd6 18.Nd2 e6 and now 19.a5! (instead of my lazy 19.Bfl-I played a4-a5 a move later) would have been thematic, destroying black's queenside pawn chain at the base and gaining a clear advantage. 50 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Summary ===:::::>- Knights are minor pieces (along with Bishops), and are generally given a point-count value of 3 (the same as Bishops). ===:::::>- Knights crave advanced support points (i.e., a safe square that can't easily be challenged by a hostile pawn). Since they are short-range pieces, having access to such a square is a huge part of proper Knight strategy. ===:::::>- Knights gain in strength as they move further up the board. As a rule of thumb: 0 A Knight stuck on the 1st or 2nd ranks is a defensive piece and is inferior to a healthy Bishop (a diseased Bishop is quite another matter). 0 A Knight on the 3rd rank is a flexible workhorse and can be used for defense or attack at a moment's notice. A Knight on the 3rd often has serious central influence. 0 A Knight on a 4th rank support point is a very strong, flexible piece. You can count on it to ably perform both defensive and offensive duties. 0 A Knight on a 5th rank support point can be a beautiful thing to behold. It's a potent offensive weapon and is usually superior to a Bishop. 0 A Knight on a 6th rank support point can make children weep and women cry for joy. Here a Knight transforms from horse to Octopus, its many appendages spiking out in all directions and claiming enemy territory as its own. Such a Knight is, at times, stronger than a Rook. 0 A Knight on the 7th and 8th ranks gives us a case of diminishing returns. Once past the 6th, it no longer controls as many squares since its reach runs out of board. Usually a Knight on such an advanced rank is performing some sort of tactical or search and destroy operation. ===:::::>- Knights are the best blockaders of enemy passed pawns. The reason for this is simple: Unlike other pieces, a Knight that's sitting in front of an enemy pawn isn't losing any of its mobility. Advantage Knight! PA RT TWO I MINOR PIE CES 51 ====.::::> Knights are short-range pieces. Unlike Bishops, which can slide the length of the board in a single move, Knights are more \"restrained\". Advantage Bishop! ====.::::> Knights can jump over other pieces. There isn't anything else that can do this. Advantage Knight! ====.::::> Knights have the potential to attack or defend anything on any colored square-it might take several moves, but eventually they will get there. Bishops are always stuck on one color. Advantage Knight! ====.::::> Knights do quite well in closed positions because, unlike Bishops, pawns can't block them. Advantage Knight! ====.::::> Because Knights are short-range pieces, you need to calmly march them to the desired post. This might take two or three moves, but it's something that needs to be done. ====.::::> If you hear a square calling out to your Knight (or see a beckoning glow), do everything in your power to get your horse there (It doesn't matter if you have to move forward, backwards, sideways, or a combination of all these things to reach it.)! ====.::::> Just because a minor piece is \"nicely\" developed to the usual respected squares on the 3rd rank doesn't mean it's doing anything from that post. Does it have a future on that square? Is it working with the other pieces towards the fulfillment of some unified plan? If the answer to these questions is \"no,\" then it's important that you find a better home for the horse and then do your utmost to get it there. 52 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Knights - Tests After thoroughly absorbing the material you've just looked at on Knights, I'm guessing that you can't wait to show your mastery of the beasts.

Two Bishops are, on occasion, also referred to as two Jans or, oddly, two Rabbis.) can roar across the length of the board in a single move. It lives for speed, and this little Formula 1 racecar makes anything that dares step onto its diagonal potential road-kill. This means that if those diagonals aren't blocked, the Bishop can be a fierce and highly prized piece. Bishops have historically been viewed as being either Good (the player's center pawns are on the opposite color as his Bishop) or Bad (the player's center pawns are on the same color as his Bishop). However, I no longer like these terms, deeming them anti-intuitive and at times confusing. For example, bad Bishops can often be active and, as a result, very strong. Or bad Bishops can also be critically useful defenders. Thus, in this book we'll refer to Bishops as Active, Useful, or Tall-Pawns. A Bishop is considered Active if it's outside the pawn chain and/or enjoying life on a reasonably clutter-free diagonal. A Bishop is considered Useful if it's doing an important (defensive or dynamic) task(s). Such a defensive Bishop can be ugly to look at, but its absence would cause your position to undergo serious difficulties. A Bishop is said to be a Tall-Pawn if it's not serving a useful function and is trapped behind its pawns (thus making it inactive). This kind of Bishop takes on the persona of an overgrown pawn that, sadly, can't turn into a Queen if it reaches the end of the board. Let's take a deeper look at each of these Bishop-types. Give a Bishop a diagonal that's uncluttered by soda cans, pens, its own pawns or a solid/well-defended wall of enemy pawns (pieces aren't clutter) and we'll consider it to be active. This doesn't mean that an active Bishop can singlehand- PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 55 edly bring down the enemy position or that it will even successfully mesh with the rest of its army. That's up to you and your skills at getting all your bits to work together for a particular goal. But an active Bishop can dash from one sector to another in a flash, so they always need to be respected. Diagram 48 Black to move White has two active Bishops here-his c4-Bishop eyes the fl-a6 and the a2-g8 diagonals, while his other Bishop patrols the cl-h6 line. Black's light-squared Bishop is also active since it eyes the c8-h3 diagonal (the d7 -Knight isn't con­ sidered clutter because it can move out of the Bishop's way whenever it wishes to). However, black's e 7-Bishop isn't particularly active because it's blocked by the d6-pawn. Of course, it does keep an eye on the shorter d8-h4 diagonal, and it also gives d6 solid support, so it's not close to being a Tall-Pawn. In fact, this Bishop can easily become something special after a ... d6-d5 push frees the f8-a3 diagonal, or it can assume diagonal supremacy if White ever captures on e5 (dxe5) since recapturing by ... dxe5 would unlock its potential. This shows us that a Bishop can become active at the drop of a hat, and that innocent looking pawn exchanges (dxe5) can easily turn a dormant enemy piece into an active one. Why are all the Bishops in diagram 48 at least reasonably active? Because the center is fluid and can open further if pawns are exchanged. However, a couple poor moves can change all this: l. ..c5? I'm sure the e7 -Bishop didn't appreciate this move! This unfortunate advance also turns d5 into a gaping hole. 2.d5? White also seems to be oblivious to the needs of his minor pieces! \"With one push of the pawn, the d5-hole has been plugged and the c4-Bishop blocked. Talk about self-defeating! Instead, 2.dxe5 Nxe5 3.Nxe5 dxe5 4.Qe2 would leave 56 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION RULE Black with that hole on d5, while the e7 -Bishop's potential has been greatly reduced. Also note that white's light-squared Bishop is a real fire breather on the a2-g8 diagonal. In the position from diagram 48, everyone started out with nice Bishops. But more often than not you'll find that your Bishop isn't setting the board on fire. Every time you move a pawn, check to see how it affects the activity of your Bishops! Obviously, turning an open position into a closed one will have a serious effect on these pieces, so train yourself to always take the health What do you do then? Being a fan of the Wizard of Oz, I tried closing my eyes, click­ ing my Birkenstocks together and saying, \"There's nothing like an active Bishop. There's nothing like an active Bishop.\" Sadly, it didn't have the desired effect-when I opened my eyes the Bishop was still sitting there doing nothing. Clearly, inactive Bishops will remain that way and care of your Bishops into account. unless you do something about it! In other words, if you possess a lazy Bishop that is sitting around daydreaming, you have to find a way to put the thing to work. This mix of Bishop-awareness (knowledge) and willpower can be quite effective. Diagram 49 MrSchlock (1732) - purplecoyote (1646), Internet 30 minute 2006 White to move A student of mine was playing White and he couldn't wait to show me this game. When he reached this position he stopped and said, \"I have pressure against d6 but it's defended by the Knight and the Rooks will soon come to its defense too.

At this point purplecoyote, not wanting blood to gush from the screen, wisely resigned. Two other things that distinguish an active Bishop is its ability to stop enemy passed pawns from a distance and its use as a \"catapult\" for its Queen. Diagram 50 White to move Ruler of the bl -h7 diagonal Okay, this is a highly exaggerated situation, but it clearly shows the Bishop stamping the whole bl -h7 diagonal with the brand of its authority. Nothing may safely step there, while in the meantime white's lone pawn, after l.d6, will waltz into d8 and make a new Queen. 58 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION l.Qe4! Diagram 51 Catapult White to move A common but important idea. The Queen uses its light-squared Bishop to set up a catapult (usually referred to as a \"battery,\" but that term reminds me of a marital debacle so I try to avoid it) that will throw it deep (and decisively) into the enemy position (in this case, on h7). This is also known as \"riding the Bishop's vapors.\" l. .. f5 There's no salvation in l.. .g6 2.Bxh6 Nxe5 (Black was lost in any case, but this makes a bad situation worse.) because after 3.Qxb7 Nxd3 4.Qa6 Nb2 5.Bxf8 Bxf8 6.Rfbl he loses the Knight and leaves White with an extra Rook. 2.exf6 e.p.

Active Bishops are nice, but at times they are merely claiming domination of unimportant real estate. In that case, you have to find (or create) something for them to do. The dream Bishop is both useful and active-it covers a lot of ground, but it is also serving a very specific (useful) purpose. PART TW O I MINOR PIECES 59 Diagram 52 White to move This is from the game A. Volokitin - Y. Pelletier, Biel 2005 (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 5.Nc3 Qc7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Qd2 Bb4 8.f3 Nxd4 9.Qxd4 Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 b6) White's dark-squared Bishop is active in that it eyes two diagonals (g1-a7 and cl -h6). However, the g1-a7 diagonal is blocked (the b6-pawn is a rock) and the cl-h6 diagonal has nothing to do with the battle for the central dark squares (the d6-square in particular is screaming for the Bishop's attention). In other words, it's active but not performing a useful function that relates to the other imbalances in the position. Of course, white's potential dark-square control is offset by the weak pawns on the c-file, so Black has his chances too. Nevertheless, even if the chances are more or less balanced, it's still up to White to pose problems for his opponent by milking his positive imbalances for all they're worth. After 26 minutes thought, Grandmaster Volokitin played the most principled move. ll.Bcl ! Heading for a3 and, ultimately, d6.

While an active Bishop might look good, a useful Bishop trades style for substance and addresses the deeper needs (both dynamic and defensive) of a position. The useful Bishop can also be purely defensive: Diagram 53 Gamera16 (1827) vs. MrSchlock (1 732), Internet 30 minute 2006 White to move One would think that White should stand better here. His Bishop is far more active than black's silly looking thing, while the e6-pawn (sitting on an open file and facing off to a pair of enemy Rooks!) is weak and the e5 -square is a gaping wound in the middle of the board. To top it off, White even has the move! Yet, things aren't so clear. It turns out that white's d-pawn isn't as safe as one might suppose, while the threat of ... Rxf3 , shattering white's King position, is serious and needs to be dealt with. Still, White can avoid that unpleasantness with both l.Re3 and l.N eS. So isn't White better after all? To find an answer to this, we need to address the Bishops. It turns out that the active white Bishop, with its proud trumpeting over its domination of the b1-h7 diagonal, isn't helping the rest of its forces deal with ... Rxf3 , or with the weakness of eS or its own slightly loose pawn on d4. On the other hand, black's despised mutant on d7 is singlehandedly keeping e6 intact (another way to look PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 61 at this is that one Bishop is holding off two enemy Rooks!). And, once e6 is no longer in peril, that \"inactive\" piece can emerge from behind its own lines via ... Bb5 or ... Ba4 or ... Bd7-e8-g6 or ... Bd7-e8-h5 and create its own brand of activity outside its pawn chain. Let's see how play continued: l.Ne5 1.Re3 Rxf3 !

The Tall-Pawn A Bishop is said to be a Tall-Pawn if it's not serving a useful function and is trapped behind its pawns (thus making it inactive). This kind of Bishop takes on the persona of an overgrown pawn and is something you should desperately try and avoid having. The worst cases of Tall-Pawns occur when a Bishop finds itself entombed. Here's a graphic example: Diagram 55 Black to move A true nightmare for White! This kind of Bishop usually loses in the middle­ game and the endgame-in both cases, the side with the entombed piece is, in effect, playing with a piece less. Here black's only concern is getting his King to e2 where it can start vacuuming up all of white's kingside pawns. There is only one way to accomplish this goal. l ... c3 ! This turns the a4-pawn into an outside passed pawn. Once white's King is forced to the a-file so it can capture the a-pawn, black's King will have a clear path to e2 -nirvana. 2.bxc3 + Kc4 3.Bgl Or 3.Kb2 a3+ 4.Kxa3 Kxc3 5.Ka4 Kd3 6.Kb4 Ke2 7.Bgl Kfl , 0- 1. 3...a3 4.Bh2 a2 5.Kb2 al=Q+ 6.Kxal Kxc3 7.Khl Kd2 8.Bgl Ke2 9.Kcl Kfl 10.Kd2 Kxgl ll.Ke3 Kg2 and f2 falls. PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 63 Our next example shows the most common kind of entombed Bishop. A student of mine, Daniel S, became a fan of the Botvinnik setup in the English Opening (l .c4 c5 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.Nc3 Nc6 5.e4 Nf6 6.d3 0-0 7.Nge2 d6 is just one possible move order) . While teaching it to him, I pointed out a typi­ cal device that I assured him would occur from time to time. To my surprise, it appeared in many of his blitz games and allowed him to reel in one point after another without a fight. Diagram 56 Daniel S (1658) - Gong, ICC 2007 White to move This one-sided position occurred after Black badly misplayed the opening: l.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 0-0 5.d3 d6 6.e4 e5 7.Nge2 Bg4 8.h3 Be6 9.0-0 Qd7 10.Kh2 c5 ll.f4 Qe8 12.f5 Bd7 13.Be3 a6 14.g4 Nc6 15.g5 Nh5 16.Nd5 Qd8. Now (from diagram 56) Daniel played 17.f6, which forces the Bishop to h8 where it will lay (like someone that's buried alive) for the rest of the game. As mentioned earlier, such a Bishop allows White to confidently play on the kingside, center, or queenside since he will have a piece more taking part in the battle. The finish was a typical bit of blitz brutality: 17 ... Bh8 18.Bf3 Nf4 19.Bxf4 exf4 20.Nexf4 Ne5 21.Ne7+, 1-0. Entombed Bishops are the exception, however. The most common Tall-Pawns are simply Bishops trapped behind (and blocked by) their pawns. A. Grischuk - C.

This unfortunate piece can't emerge on h5 (white's Queen is keeping that square under wraps), and if it tries to escape to f7 or e8 (via ... f7 -f6-of course, f7 and e8 don't look so great either) then the e6-pawn will turn into a seriously weak target. 16.Ng2 Stopping ...

Nxf4 19.Bxf4 Bd6 20.Bxd6 Qxd6 21 .Re5 While black's Bishop is pretending it's a pawn, white's Bishop will serve an active role in the center and on the queenside-it will never have to worry about being challenged by the lump on g6. White's ReS not only prepares to double on the e-file (making sure ... f7-f6 can't be played), but it also prevents a potential ... c6-c5 break. Notice how White isn't in any hurry-his plan is the killing of enemy counterplay first (why let a tied up opponent shed his chains?), and the preparation for his own decisive queenside breakthrough second. 21. ..

Rd8 is a return to passivity that ends black's ... f7-f6 hopes. Nevertheless, he needs to activate his pieces, even if it loses a pawn (anything is better than sitting around waiting to die). Thus my recom­ mendation is 24 ... Rde8 25.Qf4! f6! 26.Rxf5! (Not falling for 26. Rxe6?

Even at the end, the black Bishop is still sitting on g6, alone and forgotten. Clearly, you need to think twice before placing your pawns on the same color as your Bishop! In general, you should only do this if your Bishop can get outside the pawn chain (which would make it active), or if your Bishop is proving useful (most likely as a defender) inside the chain. 66 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Of course, all the knowledge and good intentions in the world won't stop you from ending up with a Tall-Pawn from time to time. If this occurs, you need to: __ .... Get your pawns off the color of your Bishop (unblocking it). __ .... Get your Bishop outside the pawn chain. __ .... Exchange the horrible Bishop for an enemy Bishop or Knight. The next example (played at a slow time control, so there was plenty of time to think about what was going on) shows both sides ignoring all of these rules. I don't know about Black, but White was familiar with these ideas. Daniel S (1823) - metapuff (1938), ICC 2007 l.c4 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.Nc3 0-0 5.e4 d6 6.Nge2 c5 7.0-0 e5 8.d3 Nc6 9.Bg5 Be6 10.Nd5 Bxd5 ll.cxd5 Nd4 12.Nxd4 cxd4 13.Qd2 ReS (the opening was badly played by both sides, so don't pay much attention to it) Diagram 59 Black was obviously used to people trying to swap their dark-squared Bishop for his and, apparently, he had learned to avoid it with this little Rook move. The idea is that Bh6 can now be met by ... Bh8 when the Rook would no longer be vulnerable to the white Bishop on h6. To the uninitiated, this might sound quite profound. However, it's also com­ pletely wrong! The truth is that, in this particular position, Black should welcome Don't hesitate to exchange your bad pieces for the opponent's good ones! the exchange of dark-squared Bishops with open arms! There are a couple rea­ sons for this, but the most pertinent is that the g7 -Bishop is a Tall-Pawn that's trapped behind its chain. Yes, it does defend some squares, but all in all it's a pretty ugly piece. This misconception on black's part rears its head again in a few moves. 14.Racl PART TW O I MINOR PIECES 67 White also fails his Bishop exam! His g2-Bishop isn't very happy, so White needs to activate the thing by getting it outside the pawn chain. Thus 14.Bh3 is correct (Get your Bishop outside the pawn chain.0. This not only stops potential ... Ng4 moves (after White pushes his f-pawn to f4), but it also prevents Black from posting a Rook on the open c-file. 14 ... Qb6 15.f4 White is only thinking of mate, so less brutal ideas (like getting his Bishop outside the pawn chain with 15.Bh3) are not entering his mind. 15 ... Nd7 Better was 15 ...

Instead, 17 ... g5 ! 18.Bxg7 Kxg7 shines a very different light on the position. In that case Black wisely got rid of his inactive Bishop while keeping white's f-pawn on f5 (thereby turning the g2 -Bishop into a Tall-Pawn). The resulting situation is very comfortable for Black, who has a safe King and enjoys a Knight in a closed position versus an inactive white Bishop. 18.fxg6 Suddenly White wakes up and smells the stagnating Bishops! 18 ... hxg6 1 9.Bh3 19.h4 followed by 20.Bh3 is probably even more accurate. Nevertheless, 19.Bh3 proved more than adequate to turn the tide permanently in white's favor. The rest of the game is worth looking at just so you can see how strong a Bishop can become if you manage to get it outside the pawn chain: 19.Bh3 Nc5 20.b4 Na6 21.a3 Nc7 22.Qc2 Re7 23.Qd2 NbS 24.Be6+ Kh7 2S.h4 Nxa3 26.Kg2 NbS 27.Rhl Nc3 28.Rcfl Qxb4 29.hS gS 30.BxgS fxgS 31.QxgS Rg7 32.QfS+ Kh6 33.Qf6+ Kh7 34.BfS+ Kg8 3S.Qe6+ Rf7 36.Bh7+ Kxh7 37.Qxf7+ (3 7 .Rxf7 + mates) 37 ... Bg7 38.h6 Qb2+ 39.Rf2 Qxf2+ 40.Kxf2 Nxe4+ 41.Kg2, 1-0. This just goes to show that knowing strategic concepts in a theoretical sense is one thing, while being able to actually notice it and put it to use in a real battle situation is quite another. And make no mistake about it-this inability to turn knowledge into practical application goes right up the rating ladder. One student (during our first lesson), rated 2150 FIDE, got angry when I began to talk about the proper use of minor pieces. He said, \"I already know all that stuff! \" Yet, as we went through his games, he would fail to implement any of it. Instead of treating his minor pieces right, he constantly got sidetracked by \"more important\" thoughts (material, attack, etc.). Naturally, when he lost to superior players, he rarely understood what went wrong. To cure this illness, you need to: Learn the basic ideas and concepts given in this book Reinforce the information by constant repetition. --.... Try to solve as many chess problems as possible that are devoted to imbalances. --.... Go through your own games and make a serious effort to spot where you could have improved the \"life\" of your minor pieces. PART TWO I MINOR PIE CES 69 We've all heard of the strange goings on in relation to Bishops of opposite colors. Aren't those things supposed to make endgames unwinnable even if you're a gazillion pawns down? Are we supposed to court them or avoid them? Is it true that the Apocalypse is upon us if Bishops of opposite colors appear on every board, at the same time, in the same round, of the same grandmaster tournament? I run into questions like this all the time! Of course, Bishops of opposite colors is merely a Bishop vs. Bishop battle. Yet, it's a strange battle that resembles a war between two creatures in different dimensions. Because they will live on different colored diagonals until they are placed in the after-game box, the Bishops can't touch, they can't defend what the other attacks (or attack what the other defends!), and if you place your pawns and/or King on the opposite color of the enemy Bishop, the ghost-Bishop will find that it can't touch anything at all. Diagram 61 White to move Okay, this is an insane position! But though it's ridiculous, it does a very good job at showing how absurd a Bishop of opposite colors position can be. Here White is two pawns and three pieces ahead. Black is passive, and white's King is also far better placed than black's. Yet, the game is a dead draw! How can this be? The problem for White is that his armada of dark-squared Bishops can't touch a light square if their lives depended on it. This means that the only white unit that can attack the c6-square and the g6-pawn is the King. And, since those two targets are so far apart, white's King can't skip from one to the other in a single move. Thus, Black will always have a \"pass\" move with his King ( ... Kc6-d7 /d5 and back to c6 over and over) or Bishop ( ... Bh5-dl-h5-d l, etc), depending on the direction white's King has gone. 70 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Let's look at some moves: l.Ke6 Bdl 2.Kf7 Bh5 2 ... Bc2 ?? loses to 3.h5 gxh5 4.g6 when black's remaining piece will soon have to sacrifice itself on g6 or g8. This tells us that the black Bishop must do two jobs: 1) Defend g6 if it's attacked. 2) Never lose contact with the h5-square. That way h4-h5 can always be met by ... Bxh5 when White fails to get a passed pawn. 3.Bce5 Kd7 4.Bd6 Kc6 5.Kf6 Kd5 6.Ke7 Threatening to take control over c6 by Kd7. 6 ... Kc6 Now we see that whenever white's King is ready to challenge for the c6-square, black's King must immediately scurry back to c6 and let his light-squared Bishop take over the passing duties. 7.Bc3 Bdl Black must avoid 7 ... Kd5?? 8.Kd7 Bg4+ 9.Kc7 when White has gained control over c6, thereby freeing the c5-pawn. 8.Ke6 Bg4+ 9.Kf7 Bh5 9 ... Bf5?? 10.h5 wins. 10.Kf6 Kd7, 1/z-1/z since White can't make any progress! It's clear that if we remove three of white's Bishops from diagram 61, we would get a more realistic endgame where White can't win with two healthy extra pawns. And this is where the quasi-truth that \"Bishops of opposite colors often allows the defender to draw otherwise lost endgames\" comes from. But please note the word \"often.\" Many endgames with Bishops of opposite colors are also won. Diagram 62 Black to move PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 71 This position has the same basic dynamics as found in diagram 61. If White can win the e6-pawn, win the c6-square, or turn his e5 -pawn into a passer, the game will be his. If Black can stop White from doing those things, the game will be drawn. In this case the two areas of combat (e6 and c6) are just a step away from each other, so White wins (note that the game would be drawn if black's Bishop stood on a2 , b3, c4, or d5). l.. .Bf5 No better is l. . .Bg8 2.d5+!

If you have an extra pawn or two and feel that opposite colored Bishops might make the winning process a nightmare, then go out of your way to ex­ change one of the Bishops. This sounds obvious, but I've seen many players not grab the chance for such a trade and pay for it later in a lost half point. 72 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION In diagram 63 White has a solid extra pawn and the superior King (which would love to rush into the enemy position via Kd3-c4-b5-a6). However, the d4-pawn is under pressure and a possible ... Nc7 will keep white's King out of b5. Even more bothersome is the presence of Bishops of opposite colors.

Getting rid of the opposite colored Bishops made the whole winning process smooth and worry free. Though Bishops of opposite colors do increase the defender's chances of hold­ ing an inferior endgame in many cases, the same opposite colored Bishops favors the attacker (in a middle game or endgame) if more pieces appear on the board. Diagram 64 Black to move White is two pawns up. However, his queenside majority is frozen by black's a-pawn and Bishop. What really makes black's life a living hell is the combina­ tion of white's Rook and Bishop hitting f7. This completely immobilizes black's army and leaves him waiting helplessly while White improves his position. The heat against f7, combined with the extra kingside pawn, ensures an easy victory for White. l. .. g6 2.g4 Bc3 3.f5 gxf5+ 4.gxf5 Bb4 5.f6 Bc3 6.Kf5 White calmly brings all his pieces to their optimum positions before starting the final assault.

In the other corner we have a Bishop-it enjoys super speed and can go from one edge of the board to the other in a single bound! Are you ready for the brutal battles that occur when one faces the other? Are you ready for the carnage they leave in their wake, and the wailing cries of defeat the losing side makes when his Bishop or Knight fails in this all-minor piece faceoff? Okay, then in that case, let's get ready to rumble! By now you've learned the ins and outs of both minor pieces. In fact, many of you probably have already picked a favorite. Tigran Petrosian placed Knights on a pedestal, your author also has a deep love of Knights, and most amateurs fear Knights far more than Bishops (Knights are, quite simply, trickier). On the other hand, Fischer was perhaps the greatest aficionado of Bishops ever seen, and the vast majority of grandmasters prefer Bishops to Knights. Nevertheless, whatever one's bias might be, you have to know how to get the most out of both pieces, and how to pit one against another. Fischer clearly preferred Bishops to Knights, but that didn't stop him from winning a Knight vs. Bishop battle if he felt the position favored the horse. The same can be said for Knight worshippers. If these folk find themselves in a wide-open position, chances are the Bishop will be the minor piece of preference. Ultimately, the real value of the minor pieces depends on the combined imbalances on the board. The position is closed? Knights are often for choice. Are you staring at an endgame with mutual running passed pawns? The Bishop usually wipes the floor with the Knight. And which minor piece would you choose in a position where it's all-important to be able to access both color squares-a Bishop can't do that, so a Knight is the way to go. This battle of the minor pieces-each possessing different powers-is my favorite in all of chess. HI possess a Knight, I try hard to imprint \"Knight char­ acteristics\" on the board so that the rapidly approaching battle with the enemy Bishop will favor me. If I have a Bishop, I do everything possible to make the position \"Bishop friendly.\" The ability to create a promising position for your minor piece(s) will set you apart from the other players. In fact, after losing to 78 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION your superior Knight (or Bishop), your depressed (and clueless!) opponent will often tell you that it was just bad luck that things didn't work out for him! The following things are critical in all Bishop vs. Knight battles: Be aware that there is, or there is going to be, a Bishop vs. Knight battle! Be aware of all the imbalances and how they relate to the minor piece(s) you and your opponent own. Create a board-situation that your minor piece craves! Our first example shows how an apparently simple position can actually be filled with minor piece tension: Diagram 73 White to move Please treat the variations in this example as a sort of theatrical drama-it might not be based on reality, but it has a profound effect on the viewer! I'm hoping this game will pass on a sense of urgency-a visual slap in the face that makes you exclaim, \"Wow! I didn't realize that a 'boring' minor piece battle was so important, and that it could go back and forth so easily!\" On the surface, things look easy: White has two Bishops and would like to open things up, while Black has a Bishop and Knight and would be happy if he could activate his Bishop and find a nice home for his horse. The main questions here are, should White take on e5, push to d5, or simply ignore the face-off between the d4- and e5-pawns altogether? All these decisions are dependent on how they ultimately affect the state of the minor pieces, but achieving the optimum goals proves far harder than one might suppose. Let's take a look at these three different options. Closing the Center l.dS PA RT TWO I MINOR PIECES 79 This gains space, kills off the black Bishop's hopes for an open a1-h8 diagonal, and deprives the Knight of c6. These things certainly sound great, but it all falls flat after black's thematic reply. l.. .BgS! White suddenly has nothing! Black's move forces the exchange of the dark-squared Bishops. This deprives White of his Bishop pair and (after 2 .Bxg5 Qxg5) creates a new minor piece battle of Knight vs. inactive Bishop. Passing (diagram 73) Diagram 74 White to move Black wins the minor piece battle If your opponent has two Bishops, exchange one off and create a more manageable Bishop vs. Bishop or Bishop vs. Knight scenario. l.Qd2 exd4 2.Bxd4 Bxd4 3.Qxd4 Nc6 4.Qc3 ReS S.Rfel NeS 6.Be2 QgS and Black has no problems: his Knight is a good piece, white's Bishop isn't very impressive, white's central majority isn't going anywhere, and Black enjoys some pressure against e4.

Lines like 8 ... Rxc8 9.Rxf7 Qe8 (9 ... Qxc5 ?? 10.Qe6 mates) lO.Rdfl give White a fearsome attack. Black can put up a much better defense, but I think the variations after 8.Bc8 are still fun for White. This is an enjoyable line to analyze, but has no place in this book since it takes us far afield from our Bishop vs. Knight theme. I should add that White has many good moves here. For example, 8.c6 also looks tasty and highlights the sad state of black's Knight. 8 ... f6 8 ...

Diagram 76 White finally won a minor piece battle 82 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION So does this mean that l.dxe5 is just better for White? Not necessarily! Black lost that battle because he didn't do enough to make his Knight challenge the white Bishops. So let's step back to diagram 73 and show a more principled course for Black: l.dxe5 dxe5 2.Qb3 Nc6! This is more like it! Black insists on making his Knight an active participant in the game. 3.Qxb7 Nd4 This is how a Knight should be used! 4.Bg4 4.Bxd4 exd4 5 .e5 Rb8 is okay for Black. 4 ... aS 5.Qd5 Qe7 6.c5 Rab8 gives Black good compensation for the sacri­ ficed pawn. Diagram 77 Black's Knight is strutting its stuff I should add that after l.dxe5 Black isn't forced to take back with his pawn. Here's a final minor piece battle from the position in diagram 73: l.dxe5 Bxe5 2.c5 White opens things up as much as possible. Instead, 2.Bg4 Nc6 3.f4 Bxb2 (3 ... Bf6 4.Qd2 Re8 5 .BB gives White an edge, thanks to his center and two nice Bishops) 4.Rbl Bf6 is okay for Black after 5.Rxb7 Na5 6.Rb4 c5 7.Ra4 Qc7 8.BB Nc6. 2 ...

Nc6-d4 at some point). PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 83 We've seen the minor piece battle swing back and forth in these lines. Clearly, the Bishop versus Knight faceoff is important and calls for energetic and pointed play if you wish to see your minor piece reign supreme. The }�wo Bishops Now let's settle down a bit and take a look at some basic situations. First on our agenda is the extremely common two Bishops vs. Bishop and Knight battle (I consider this to be an extension of a Bishop vs. Knight situation, though an ex­ change of Knight for Bishop would turn that into a pure Bishop vs. Bishop fight). Possessing two Bishops is far better than only having one because the Bishop's main weaknesses-it's inability to control a whole color complex-is cured by the fact that both white and dark diagonals can now be fully patrolled. Of course, if the position is closed and all diagonals are blocked, the Bishops might not be very impressive. But, in general, the Bishop pair is indeed a nice thing to have and needs to be dealt with by the opponent. The simplest way to remove this problem is to exchange one of the enemy Bishops (either by trading your Knight or Bishop for an enemy Bishop), thus creating a far more manageable Bishop vs. Knight or Bishop vs. Bishop situation.

It's important to note that white's queenside majority, though it controls key squares on d4 and d5, isn't able to expand or transform itself into a passed pawn. Since Bishops work together very well and control two important diagonals, Black wastes no time in initiating an exchange. 23 ... Bh6! There goes white's pair of Bishops! 24. Bxh6 Nxh6 With it's dark-squared brother off the board, the light-squared Bishop will prove to be remarkably ineffective. PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 85 From this point on, White can't hope for more than a draw. The Knight will show itself to be far more flexible than the Bishop, and black's central pawn majority will prove hard to contain. 25.Bh3 Kg7 Black's in no hurry, so he uses his King to tighten up the loose dark squares on f6 and h6. 26.Qe2 Qc7 27.Rxd8 Rxd8 28.Rdl Rxdl+ 29.Qxdl f5 The rest of the game will be given with minimal comment.

True, white's King is still in the middle and, at times, opening things up to punish the enemy's King position takes precedence over any gains you give to the Bishop pair.

Bisho£S vs. Knights In our last example, White had the two Bishops but the dark-squared Bishop was the hero since it not only found a home on a very long and clear diagonal, but there was nothing in black's camp that could oppose it. This same idea comes to the fore when contemplating the intricacies of Bishop vs. Knight. If the Knight hasn't found some god-like support point, and if the Bishop finds a clear diagonal, then the Knight will often be at a disadvantage. The Great Breakout I. Ivanov - J.

Of course, the Bishop might be used to temporarily support d6 by ... Bc7, or hit c3 after ... a4 followed by ... BaS. All this shows just how flexible the Bishop is on d8.

Ivanov lost on time, but his position is completely hopeless. Two Knights don't work particularly well together, so exchanging one of them (for an enemy Bishop or Knight) is usually a good idea. In a way, a Bishop vs. Knight battle is a pretty clear-cut thing. Let's have a look at the basics. Owner of the Bishop: ••..,.. Make it as active as possible by placing it on a free diagonal, or creating an uncluttered diagonal if one doesn't already exist. Prove that it's performing a key function and is thus extremely useful. Steer things into an endgame where the long-range capabilities of the Bishop give it a huge edge over the enemy Knight. Don't allow the enemy Knight to find its way to an advanced, permanent support point. This calls for Anti-Knight Strategy-Do your best to take away all advanced squares from the enemy horse! Owner of the Knight: Closing the position is often good for your Knight. Steer for endgames where all the pawns are on one side of the board. This negates the enemy Bishop's long-range abilities while amplifying the importance of the Knight's ability to attack both white and dark squares. Do your best to create a permanent advanced home (support point) for your Knight. If a tasty support point exists but it seems a long way away (and/or very difficult to reach), try hard to find a way to get there! It might take several moves, but that's what moves are for-to place your pieces on their best squares so they can exert maximum effect on the board. --� Avoid \"Trapped Knight Syndrome\"! Many a Knight has been lost when it found itself trapped by the enemy Bishop. Let's take a look at some of these ideas. PART TW O I MINOR PIECES 91 The Incarcerated Knight Diagram 84 A. Bisguier - R. Fischer, Bled 1961 Black to move Black's a pawn up but it's doubled, which means he can't force a passed kingside pawn (White just places his pawn on g3 and the enemy pawns can't force their way through). So the real battle (aside from King position, which is always important in the endgame) is going to center on the Bishop vs. Knight imbalance-at the moment the Knight is attacking a7 and also has dreams of cramming itself into d6 via Nd6 followed by e3-e4-e5 when it would be impossible for Black to win since the Knight would be too strong. Fischer's move immediately addresses these issues. l.. .Bd7!

Diagram 86 This kind of structure would usually favor Black in every phase of the game­ the holes on b4 and d4 make the Knight very valuable, and Black would be PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 93 delighted to swap dark-squared Bishops, ridding White of his Bishop pair and highlighting the weakness of the dark squares on b4, c5, and d4. Clearly, the position in diagram 86 is very nice for Black. But what if we make a slight adjustment? Diagram 87 \"'White to move Here (diagram 87) we have the same position, but this time the c-pawn is on c2 . Suddenly White has all the chances since the Knight can be contained by l.c3. Using your pawn(s) to deprive the enemy Knights of advanced squares is Anti-Knight Strategy. You will be (or should be!) making use of it often, so look at these examples over and over until the Anti-Knight Strategy idea makes perfect sense to you. Once the concept is burned into your brain, you'll (hopefully!) be less likely to push your pawns forward and blindly give up squares as you do so. Remem­ ber: pawns can't move backwards, so every time they advance, potential control of squares is lost. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't march pawns up the board-doing so gains space and often makes the pawn a dynamic part of the proceedings. Just be aware of the downside. Even the Most Innocent Pawn-Move Can Potentially Weaken a Square R. Fischer - S. Reshevsky, 2nd Piatigorsky Cup 1966 l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Rel b5 This perfectly reasonable move, which gains queenside space and attacks white's Bishop, is the main line of the Ruy Lopez. But as good as it is, it does contain some potential flaws: quite often White will hit it with a2-a4 when a capture on bS opens the a-file for the al -Rook and also leaves the b5-pawn a bit loose. The other potential (though rarely seen) flaw is the c5-square-this pawn can't protect it anymore. That leaves the black d-pawn to perform babysitting duty 94 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION on that square, and if it dares move to d5 later in the game then the c5-square suddenly becomes a gaping hole. 7.Bh3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Nd7 10.d4 Nb6 11.Nbd2 exd4 12.cxd4 d5 13 .Bc2 Be6 14.e5 Qd7 15.Nb3 Bf5 16.Bg5!

Rfe8 17.Bxe7 Rxe7 18.Rcl Nb4 Diagram 88 White to move White has an advantage in space in the center. Black has a majority of queenside pawns, but its crippled since an eventual push to c5 would simply hang mate­ rial. On the other hand, white's centrallkingside pawn majority is still alive and kicking-if those pawns can get moving with f2-f4-f5 then Black might well be overrun. Black's unfortunate condition is caused by the fact that he's saddled with a backward c-pawn and a hole on c5. If he can't find a way to generate some play on his own (very hard to do if your opponent doesn't have any weaknesses to attack), then he'll be in for a long night of suffering. Note that while c5 is a hole (black's pawns can't cover it), c4 isn't. Why? Because a later b2-b3 will make the c4-square inhospitable to black's pieces. 19.Nc5! Bxc2 Worse is 19 ...

Qe8 21 .Qxh4 PART TWO I MINOR PIECES 95 Diagram 89 Now we can see the point of white's play: By exchanging his light-squared Bishop (which had no influence on c5) for a Knight (which could eventually challenge that square), White ensures total domination of c5 for the rest of the game. Even if Black manages to exchange his remaining Knight for white's on c5, a Rook will take its place and pour agony down the c-file when White doubles or even triples against c7. What we are seeing is a strategic exchange of minor pieces that's designed to \"win\" an advanced square. Since black's Bishop is doomed to remain on light­ squares, it will never be able to take part in the battle for c5. 21.. .aS 22.Qc3 Bg6 22 ... Bf5 23 .Nh4 Bc8 24.f4would be just as bad-White would enjoy a marked advantage in every sector of the board, while black's Bishop would be a non-entity in the coming battles on the kingside (White dreams of f4-f5-f6 shattering the enemy King's pawn cover) and down the c-file. 23 .Nh4 A knight on the rim isn't always grim. This is a good move that frees the f-pawn and also eyes the key f5-square (it's important because White would eventually like to push his f-pawn to f5). 23 ...

The problem is his Bishop-its long-range powers are useless because all the pawns are on one side of the board. To make matters worse, White has placed his King and pawns on dark squares. This means that black's Bishop can't ever attack them. To draw, all White has to do is move his Bishop randomly around the board until Black finally bows to the inevitable.

Life is far nicer from black's point of view. He's dominating the game, his heavy pieces are mercilessly punishing White, and his Knight will prove to be far stronger that the Bishop. In fact, since c2 is the target, the Knight would like to join in the hunt (always do your best to get all your pieces working for the same goal). 100 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 94 If you could drop your Knight on a fine support point where it gives a slap to c2 , what square would that be? Clearly, the answer is d4, and the road to d4 is ... Nf6-d7-b8-c6-d4 (or, in some cases, ... Nf6-h7-g5-e6-d4). That's a long journey, but white is helpless and the rewards are enormous (if the Knight gets to d4, white's game would do an immediate belly-flop). 26 ... g6!

Here are the basics: Owner of the Bishop: ::::::::::::::: Make it as active as possible by placing it on a free diagonal, or creating an uncluttered diagonal if one doesn't already exist. ::::::::::::::: Prove that it's performing a key function and is thus extremely useful. ::::::::::::::: Steer things into an endgame where the long-range capabilities of the Bishop give it a huge edge over the enemy Knight. ::::::::::::::: Don't allow the enemy Knight to find its way to an advanced, permanent support point. This calls for Anti-Knight Strategy-Do your best to take away all advanced squares from the enemy horse! Owner of the Knight: ::::::::::::::: Closing the position is often good for your Knight. ::::::::::::::: Steer for endgames where all the pawns are on one side of the board. This negates the enemy Bishop's long-range abilities while amplifying the importance of the Knight's ability to attack both white and dark squares. ::::::::::::::: Do your best to create a permanent advanced home (support point) for your Knight. ::::::::::::::: If a tasty support point exists but it seems a long way away (and perhaps impossible to reach), try hard to find a way to get there! It might take several moves, but that's what moves are for-to place your pieces on their best squares so they can exert maximum effect on the board. ::::::::::::::: Avoid \"Trapped Knight Syndrome\"! Many a Knight has been lost when it found itself trapped by the enemy Bishop. ::::::::::::::: Anti-Bishop pair formula: In the case of two Bishops vs. a Bishop and Knight, the simplest way to remove the opponent's Bishop pair is to exchange one of the enemy Bishops (either by trading your Knight or Bishop for an enemy Bishop), thus creating a far more manageable Bishop vs. Knight or Bishop vs. Bishop situation. ::::::::::::::: Two Knights don't work particularly well together, so exchanging one of them (for an enemy Bishop or Knight) is usually a good idea.

Summary Rooks-Tests Let's start out with a simple but powerful statement: If you want your Rook(s) to be effective, they need an open file. This seems obvious, but the trick is to demand your Rooks get an open file-yet many players merely hope that one will magically materialize and, when it doesn't, wonder why things didn't go their way. Without an open file, a Bishop or Knight might easily outperform the Rook, leaving it sitting passively behind its pawns while it sadly dreams of unrealized potential. Yes, this is basic, but it's also extremely important and is often neglected by beginners and even tournament players in the \"E\" (under 1200), \"D\" (1200 to 13 99), \"C\" (1400 to 1599) and \"B\" (1 600 to 1799) levels. In fact, the battle to energize your Rooks starts right in the opening. For example, a glance at this poor opening sequence by White will immediately send a message to a trained eye: l.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Nc3 Diagram 107 The message is that White, most likely, isn't even thinking about the future of his Rooks! In fact, when I teach someone that plays in this type of fashion, I ask him, \"What about your Rooks? \" Usually the answer I get is something like, \"Well, I'm just trying to develop my pieces. I'll deal with the Rooks later.\" Of course, invariably I find that this kind of player experiences serious problems activating his Rooks, and \"later\" often never comes. Returning to that rather innocuous opening sequence (e3 was early-why block your own dark-squared Bishop for no good reason?), we would find that instead of 3.Nc3 (which blocks the c-pawn and leaves the Knight on a square where it ll O HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION won't find much of a life), far better is 3.c4 and only then Nc3 . The difference is felt by white's whole army-suddenly the Knight on c3 , combined with the pawn on c4, isn't alone in its battle against d5. And, once the Rook moves to cl, a later cxd5 will allow it to exert influence down the c-file. Clearly, pawn tension and pawn breaks are the tools that create open (or half-open) files, and their use goes from the very basic (just seen in diagram 1 07) to the moderately basic (diagram 108), to solid tournament level (diagram 109), to the downright advanced (diagram 11 2). Diagram 108 White to move In this position (diagram 108) black's Rooks don't have many options as far as open files go. However, White's Rooks see happy times ahead by f2 -f4 (now or later) gaining kingside space and suddenly making the fl -Rook a participant in the upcoming battle, or by b2-b4 (now or later) fighting for a queenside initiative and striving to get the a1 -Rook into the thick of things on that wing.

Nxd5 16.exd5 Bd7 17.Rfel Diagram 11 0 Now we can see the point of white's 15 .N d5-the former e4-pawn has moved off the e-file and onto d5 where it gains space and frees up that file for its Rooks. This allows them to exert tremendous pressure against the e7 -pawn. 17 ... Re8 18.c3 h5 A move based on fear. Black was worried about g2-g4 and makes a move to prevent that advance and also to make f5 accessible to black's Bishop. However, the cure is worse than the disease since now black's kingside is seriously weakened (as shown by the rest of the game). 19.Re3 White intends to double on the e-file and increase his pressure against e7. Chess is easy to play when you have an open road to a glaring weakness (e7). However, the trick isn't in using these things (anyone can do that), it's in creat­ ing them! 19 ... Bf5 Calmly following his plan. The alternative, 19 ... Bxd4 20.Rxd4 Bf5, allows White to make use of the same strong Bishop maneuver that's seen in the game. 20.Bxg7 Kxg7 21 .Rdel Moves don't get more obvious or natural than this! Doubling on the e-file will force two black pieces to play babysitter to the e7-pawn.

His huge Knight (compare it to black's horrible Bishop) and pressure against b5 gives him all the chances. He could play the position slowly and torture his opponent, but instead he realized that black's King doesn't have many defenders, and that his own Queen and Knight were putting some heat in that direction. A real attack might easily appear if his Rooks were on an open file and could penetrate into the enemy position. Therefore, why not bust open the b-file? 36.a4! Forcibly smashing the file open.

As we've seen, a file is a very valuable commodity because it's the road that your Rook (and/or Queen) travels on in order to penetrate into the enemy position. That's why such files are fiercely fought over, with both sides trying hard to make it their own. The most common way of wresting a file from the opponent is to pressure the enemy Rook and give it a simple but painful choice: trade on the file and give it up, or move the Rook away from the file, which also gives it up. Diagram 113 White to move Black is in serious trouble because his Knight will prove to be much worse than white's Bishop, the dark-squares around his King are weak and easily probed by the Bishop, and White will manage to take over the d-file and use it to penetrate into the enemy position. l.Bg5!

A common situation occurs when both side's Rooks are facing off on a file and, apparently, nobody will ever own it. However, occasionally an odd little Bishop maneuver pops up that temporarily breaks the connection of the oppos­ ing Rooks, allowing the stronger side to double or even triple behind it. Then the Bishop can be moved and the prize (the file) taken. V. lvanchuk - V.

Thus, in these situations the Rooks usually just stare at each other, refusing to give ground. However, lvanchuk finds a way to get past all that and claim the c-file for himself. 24.Bc7! Nice!

Waiting to Pull the File-Opening Trigger Another interesting situation occurs when a pawn capture can open up a file. In that case, if the side that can initiate the file-opening pawn capture also possesses more space in that area, he can double Rooks behind the pawn and only make use of the pawn trade when the resulting open file will clearly be his.

Control of the 7th or 8th Ranks The importance of open/half-open files (creating them, fighting to dominate them, penetrating into the enemy position on them, and using them to pres­ sure weak enemy pawns) should be clear by now, but equally important is the enormous power of a Rook on the 7th or 8th rank. Eighth rank incursions are usually of a tactical or attacking nature, and back rank mates are part of every beginner's tactical training. Diagram 11 8 White to move Black appears to be okay since his pieces are all defended and he's even cre­ ated luft by ... h7 -h6 (that stops all those nasty back rank mates, doesn't it?). However, after l.Qxf8+! Black has to resign since l.. .Kh7 leaves him a whole Rook down, while 1 ... Kxf8 2.Rd8 mate is both sudden and brutal.

However, control of the 7th rank is particularly prized because it not only annoys the enemy King, but also targets all the enemy pawns that sit on that rank. Diagram 121 White to move Black is a piece ahead, but a series of discovered checks (this kind of position is known as a windmill) will divest him of most of his army.

The following examples should put this in perspective. Diagram 126 White to move White has a Rook on the 7th rank, but who cares? There aren't any targets on that rank, and black's King isn't bothered in the least by white's empty 7th rank acquisition. Though White has the move, he's quite lost (white's pawns on a4 and c4 are ripe and ready for the taking). Thus, control of the seventh and eight ranks is symbolic of what a Rook might accomplish there. If it's not able to \"do its stuff'', then don't bother moving there in the first place. Diagram 127 White to move White controls the only open file, so he has all the chances in this position. Mter all the hoopla about the 7th rank, we simply have to ask if White should make the leap into d7? If black's Rook stood on e8 instead of f8, then l.Rd7 would be very strong, but in our actual position the grab for \"7th\" is misguided since it can be easily challenged. l.Rd7 Rf7 2.Rd8+ Rf8 and white's not accomplishing anything at all. Since the 7th rank just isn't to be had, White would be well advised to show patience and improve the position of his King with l.Kf3. PA RT THREE I ROOKS 127 G. Maroczy - A.

He got some friends together and they all hunkered down in the grandmaster's apartment for several days, never leaving or seeing the light of day, and living on a diet of pizza, earthworms, and dried paint chips. Their ordeal only ended when the position had been completely deconstructed, rebuilt, and mastered. Doing a deep analysis (alone or with friends) of any complex position is not only highly enjoyable, but also extremely instructive (though I recommend stocking up on real food and avoiding the earthworms and paint chips). If you have a chess teacher, then all the better! You can turn over your analysis to the chess pro and see how close to reality you were, and then have him show you the things you did wrong and help you fix those weak points. Of course, most people can't afford the time for a seven-day adult slumber chess party (imagine your wife pounding on the door screaming, \"Harold! Harold! What about your job Harold? What are you doing in there?\"). Don't despair! Analyze the posi­ tion of interest over a several week period, giving it an hour here and an hour there. You'll find the time was well spent! 24 ...

On the other hand, Black has held fast, and has also begun his own bid to race the e4- and B-pawns to his 8th rank and promote them. The goals are clear, though achieving them is going to be based on pure tactics. This example is raw entertainment, with the rub that it helps solidify the un­ derstanding that getting one's heavy pieces (and pawns, since if they get to the eighth they turn into heavy pieces) to those ranks is serious business! 29 ... e3 ! Since black's goal is to get his pawns to the 8th rank, why waste a critical tempo moving the Bishop? In fact, in positions of this nature, time (rushing towards your goal with as much speed as possible) is often more important than material.

Summary ====::::::>- If you want your Rook(s) to be effective, they need an open file. ====::::::>- Without an open file, a Bishop or Knight might easily outperform the Rook, leaving it sitting passively behind its pawns while it sadly dreams of unrealized potential. ====::::::>- A half-open file is often used to exert tremendous pressure against weak enemy pawns. ====::::::>- A file is a very valuable commodity because it's the road that your Rook travels on in order to penetrate into the enemy position. That's why such files are often fought over, with both sides trying hard to make it their own. ====::::::>- The importance of open/half-open files (creating them, fighting to dominate them, penetrating into the enemy position on them, PART THREE I ROOKS 131 and using them to pressure weak enemy pawns) should be clear by now, but equally important is the enormous power of a Rook on the seventh or 8th rank. � 8th rank incursions are usually of a tactical or attacking nature, and back rank mates are part of every beginner's tactical training. � A Rook on the 8th rank can lead to all sorts of fun. However, control of the 7th rank is particularly prized because it not only annoys the enemy King, but also targets all the enemy pawns that have yet to venture forward.

Is he doomed? Mental Breakdown 1 and \"I Must\" Bowing to Panic It's My Party The Eerie The :a - ::z: C) en Over the years, I've given innumerable lessons and lectures where the sacri­ fice of material has been addressed. Players of all ratings are, in general, quite comfortable parting with their stuff if a King-hunt and the promise of mate is in the air. However, if material should be sacrificed for positional reasons I've noticed a state of mental \"rigor mortis\" strike even the hardiest players-they just can't bring themselves to part with a pawn or the Exchange (things you can see, understand, and even feel) if the return is mere positional \"compensation\" (A term that reminds us of snake-oil; it promises the world, but always remains invisible to the amateur's eye). I never realized the full extent of this problem until I taught one particular student who loved to launch unsound mating attacks. He'd toss a Bishop in the garbage if it allowed him to give the enemy King a few (more often than not, harmless) checks. I didn't want to fully discourage his aggressive inclinations, but I did want to show him that there are other ways to win a game and that attacks are usually a natural manifestation of various positive imbalances. Mter quite a few lessons, we finally got around to discussing positional Exchange sacrifices and he fell in love with the idea. Every time I would show him an example, he would say, \"Man, I wish I could do that!\" I would assure him that the opportunity would arise and, sure enough, his big chance eventually appeared. In diagram 13 9 (see next page) it's clear that Black has played very passively, but everything seems to be defended. White, seeing that Black intended to double on the e-file, played l.Rfel and after l.. .Rfe8 he followed with 2.Rxe7 and subsequently allowed the exchange of all the Rooks. The resulting position looked (and is) great, but it proved difficult to penetrate and a draw was the eventual result. I pointed out to White that he could have targeted the two weak pawns on d6 and f6 (before or after the Rook exchanges) via Ne4 with Bel-c3 and Qd2-b2 to follow (mixed with a well-timed h3 -h4). This would have left Black in a good deal of pain. However, far more interesting to me was something that most chess masters would do without thinking: 136 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 139 Student (1655) - NN (1627), Los Angeles 2004 White to move l.Rfe 1 Rfe8 2.Re6!! We had looked at similar \"plug\" sacrifices in other lessons, so when he no­ ticed this possibility he said, \"I saw it, but just couldn't bring myself to give the Rook away. I don't even get a pawn for it, and there's no kingside attack at all! I wanted to do it because of what you showed me in past lessons, but my hand refused to make the move!\" Clearly, the ingrained programming that prevents us from giving away mate­ rial is extremely strong. As a result, the point of this chapter isn't just to give examples of material sacrifice, but also to help the student break down those walls that prevent him from following his \"imbalance training.\" Let's start by asking a simple question: \"Why is 2.Re6 such a good move?\" It's clear that the Rook is a monster on this square, and if it's allowed to remain it not only kills off both black Rooks but it also adds to the pressure against both f6 and d6. But all this won't mean much to the amateur, who will rightly demand to know why the Rook can't be taken. Of course, it can be taken, but after 2 ... Bxe6 3 .dxe6 we are left with the following one-sided breakdown of the imbalances: Diagram 140 Black to move PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 137 Black: --� Up a solid Exchange. White: --� More queenside, kingside, and central space. He possesses two very active Bishops. The pawn on d6 is very weak. The pawn on f6 is also vulnerable and can be tortured by Nd5 followed by swinging the Queen and dark-squared Bishop over to the al-h8 diagonal. ••� The d5-square is a gaping hole, which can be a home to his Knight or Bishop. The protected passed pawn on e6 is a monster! --� White's minor pieces are extremely active while black's two minor pieces are comically placed. Black's Rooks don't have any open files and are both dead. In fact, white's minor pieces are far stronger than the enemy Rooks! What's clear is that White has every advantage in the position, while black's only claim to fame is his material advantage. They need to be weighed against each other, and in this case it's not even close since, on top of everything else (I'll repeat myself here since it's a very important point), the black Rooks (due to their lack of open files) are actually weaker than any one of white's minor pieces! Nevertheless, the mere fact that Black has a material advantage is more than enough to convince most players to reject the line starting with 2 .Re6. It's a pure case oflogic vs. unfounded fear. How can a player get beyond this fear? He has to train himself to view each imbalance as something wonderful, and he has to view material as just another imbalance to be collected or rejected, depending on the nature of the individual position. PHILOSOPHY In all cases of logic vs. fear, you must learn to embrace logic by reading the board and doing what it tells you to do. If a player is going to master my concept of \"reading the needs of a position by recognizing and trying to make use of all the imbalances\" then he must place material gain or sacrifice on that same list. Yes, some imbalances do have a bit more importance than others. However, although material or an insecure King both demand extra attention, you can't place them on a pedestal and lose sight of the big picture. 138 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 141 V. Ivanchuk - P. Harikrishna, Merida 2007 Black to move If I told most non-masters that they could have this position as \\Vhite, they wouldn't be too pleased. After all, Black seems safe enough, and he's a pawn up and also has the move. Nevertheless, \\Vhite has his perks too and these must be dispassionately weighed against black's small material plus. Take a moment and see if you can list the imbalances. Ready? Okay, here's how I see it: Black-One extra pawn. That's it! That's all he has to crow about. Nevertheless, it does carry some weight and forces \\Vhite to prove sufficient compensation since, if Black can hold things together and manage to make some soothing trades, then he might go on to win an endgame with that \"litde\" extra passed pawn. White-The d3 -Bishop is \"good\" (and active!), while black's Bishop is not only undefended but also playing the role of a defensive pawn. Black's pawns on d5 and f5 are both vulnerable and will need to be carefully defended. \\Vhite's Knight is a tower of strength while the black steed is a passive defender. \\Vhite's Queen is far more active than black's. \\Vhite's control of the open e-file takes aim at the slighdy vulnerable e6-Bishop and also the hole on e5. \\Vhen you add up these things, it's clear that \\Vhite has a lot going for him and full compensation for the pawn. In a nutshell, his army is more active than black's, Black has several weak squares in his camp, and \\Vhite has clear targets (on d5 and f5) to attack while white's position is free from weaknesses. Of course, Black is far from doomed but, using the words of Ivanchuk, \"For the central pawn \\Vhite has a good game and well-placed pieces.\" PART FOUR I PSY CHOL O GICAL MEANDERINGS 139 The game continued quietly, with White calmly building up his forces and adding pressure to the enemy targets: 22 ...

The student should carefully look over these first two examples again. Clearly, the first one gave White a domi­ nating position, with Black bound and gagged and completely helpless-players 1400 and higher should feel extremely comfortable (even excited!) giving up rna- terial for such a one-sided result. PHILOSOPHY Learn to treat material gains and losses as you would any other imbalance. Our second example (Ivanchuk vs. Harikrishna) was altogether different. In that case White had good compensation for the sacrificed pawn, but many players wouldn't feel completely comfortable in white's shoes. This kind of nuanced sacrifice would be more natural for players 2000 and higher. Nevertheless, whether a player is comfortable with something or not, if you read the board and decide that it's the right thing to do based on our battle of imbalances, then you should bravely give it a try; at the very least, when you see such things occur in master games you'll finally understand why it was done and have a greater appreciation for the concept. Of course, sacrifices do carry some element of risk since if you don't get enough compensation, or don't use that compensation properly, you can easily find yourself down material in some miserable endgame, or wiped out even earlier by the enemy's greater firepower. Naturally, there will be cases where you think a positional sacrifice is called for but misjudge the extent of your compensation and go down in flames. In those instances, you have to dust off your ego, analyze what went wrong, and give it another try if the board begs you to do so. 140 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION A good example comes from my own career: I was never comfortable with giving up my Queen for other units. Even if the material I got for my Queen put me ahead, I still didn't like it. This mental block stayed with me right up to the high 21 00 level, and it was only PHILOSOPHY Don't allow yourself to develop a fear of any aspect of the game! Once that fear becomes a habit, your ability to progress in chess will be severely hampered. Positions with various forms of material inequality are the basis of many cases of psychological chess paralysis. after I lost a game due to my inability to swap off my Queen for the op­ ponent's Rook, Bishop, and Knight (obviously this is more than enough for the Queen, but unreasoning fear is often a stronger force than logic and facts) that I decided to put an end to the nonsense once and for all. From that point on I never hesitated to enter such situations. At first I wasn't comfortable with this \"other stuff for my Queen\" idea, but if I felt that I would stand well with a solid position and a Rook, Bishop and pawn for my Queen, I would push fear away and do it! How about three minor pieces for my Queen? No problem! And, slowly but surely, such things became a natural part of my game and fear stopped playing any role in that kind of decision. My philosophy was clear: If you lose you lose, but at least you have the courage to stand up for what you think is right for the posi­ tion. There's nothing worse than getting pushed off the board and realizing that a lack of self-confidence didn't allow you to even put up a fight!

Svidler decided to go for the gusto: 26.Bg4 h6 27.Rxf5 Qg7 28.Qe7?! This eventually allows Black to gain a bit of time kicking the Queen around. 28.Qh4 was better, with equal chances. 28 ... gxf5 29.Bxf5 Diagram 143 Optically this looks pretty good. White gets a pawn for the Exchange, c2 is well defended, the enemy pawns on a 7 and d4 need looking after, and the posi­ tion of the black King has become a bit drafty. It's clear that White has real compensation, but there's a problem: White needs to play with energy and try to develop some initiative. If Black can prevent this, and if he can consolidate his position and activate his Rooks, they might end up overpowering the White army. Indeed, after some errors this is exactly what happened: 29 ...

After 46.Re4 the game is just over. 46 ... Qf2+ 47.Khl h4, 0- 1. So was Svidler's Exchange sacrifice the wrong thing to do? Will the trauma make him avoid such sacrifices in the future? Not at all! His decision made good sense, but he was outplayed and the game slipped out of his hands. It happens to everyone. I guarantee that he'll be making many more Exchange sacrifices as his career continues. 142 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Only by trying something and getting hands-on experience can you truly understand it.

Fischer, Reykjavik 1972 (13th match game) l.e4 Nf6 2.e5 NdS 3.d4 d6 4.Nf3 g6 5.Bc4 Nb6 6.Bb3 Bg7 7.Nhd2 0-0 8.h3 aS 9.a4 dxeS 10.dxe5 Diagram 144 Some people consider this game to be the greatest of all time (though our focus will be on the initial greed, not the later brilliance). In this position Fischer is putting some pressure against the space-gaining e5-pawn (though it's easily defended). Oddly, the most accessible target (remember that something is only weak if you can bring pieces to bear on it) is the pawn on a4 ( ... Na6-c5 combined with ... Qe8 and, if need be, ... Bd7), but capturing it (which entails a loss of time) will give White definite compensation in the form of central space and development (as Black tosses everything at a4, White will be getting the rest of his army out). In this example, we aren't looking at the safe consumption of a weak pawn. Instead, we're going to see a player create divergent imbalances (the trade of time/development for material) in an effort to sharpen the play and give himself a shot at victory. Naturally, this approach can lead to joy or despair, depending on whether the bout of greed is positionally and/or tactically justified, and on which player can handle the tension better.

So, sometimes going after material entails a certain level of risk-in much the same way that giving it up might be risky. But more often than not, taking material is business as usual-acquiring stuffis merely the other side of the ma­ terial coin. In fact, most games are won by eating the opponent's pieces, made possible by his blunders, or via the slow and steady accumulation of positive imbalances that ultimately result in material gain (creating weaknesses, freezing those weaknesses, surrounding them, and finally cashing in). Diagram 145 J. Birkel - J. Silman, American Open 1993 Black to move Read this position and you'll quickly realize that Black has the superior pawn structure and better-placed pieces. His main target is a3 , which is attacked by the aS-Rook, e7-Bishop, and c4-Knight. So black's plan, though unimaginative, is simple and effective: win the a3 -pawn! 16 ... Qb6! 144 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Offering the exchange of Queens is eminently logical. Why?

Imbalances vs. Material The following game-a very complex one-sees Black chatting with two little devils sitting on both shoulders.

In fact, taking mate­ rial and daring your opponent to prove his compensation puts a lot of pressure on him since, to put it in a stark manner, if the sacrifice doesn't work the game is over. The two most famous greed-kings are grandmasters Larry Evans and Victor Korchnoi. These extremely successful players would take whatever was offered and then hang on for dear life! However, in the position in diagram 14 7 Black noticed a far more creative (but not necessarily superior) possibility: 6 ... dxe3!!? 7.Nxb6 exf2+ 8.Kxf2 axb6 Diagram 148 Has Black gone berserk? That's right. White has a Queen and the move for two minor pieces and a pawn. Yet, White's position is far from easy to handle. Let's have Mr. Mayo himself explain his logic behind the startling 6 ... dxe3: 146 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION \"For the queen, Black has an ultra safe King, two minor pieces, an extra pawn, plus almost total dark square control. Also, consider the lovely squares Black gets for his minors-e5, e6, c5, c6 or even d4 beckon piece placement. \"White has a displaced King, development deficit and a horrible light-squared Bishop with no active prospects. He is faced with the immediate loss of two more pawns with ... Bxb2 and so his Queen is confined to defensive duties. One other critical factor to be considered is that White does not have a single effective pawn lever at his disposal. He does not even have the prospect of an active Exchange sacrifice to alter the position (only perhaps passive sacs with Rd5 at some future point).\" In short, black's pieces will be more active than white's, White has no way to break into the enemy position, and Black has various targets (squares and pawns) that he can chew on while the white position is devoid of any plan. It's clear that Mr. Mayo has a very good grasp of the imbalances and how to measure their pros and cons without falling victim to purely material (point count) considerations. Okay, I can imagine many of you saying, \"Nice, but I could never do anything like that.\" Why not? Yes, you have to somehow free yourself of the \"I can't\" mindset, which is also explored in Part Four. But once you notice 6 ... dxe3 , and once you see that you'll be giving up your Queen for two minors and a pawn, don't panic and say, \"No way! \" Instead calmly look at the imbalances in the resulting position and, if you appreciate what you are getting for the material investment (many positive imbalances for material), why not pull the trigger and do it? In .,It � fact, if you really want to im- REMEMBER prove, you should always jump If you create \"imbalance vision\" and make the search for (and understanding of) imbalances an addiction, your playing strength will take a quantum leap forward. on such situations (win or lose) so you can expand your chess mind and plant the seeds for future successes. In the game, Mr. Mayo's concept came through with flying colors: 9.Qd2 Nc6 10.Nf3 Nf6 ll.Bd3 Ng4+ 12.Ke2 0-0 13.h3 Nge5 14.Nxe5 Nd4+ 15.Kf2 Bxe5 16.Rhfl d6 17.Kgl Be6 18.Qb4 Nc6 19.Qb5 Ra5 20.Qb3 Rfa8 21.a3 b5 22.Qc2 bxc4 23.Be2 Bd4+ 24.Khl Ne5 25.Radl Bc5 26.Rfel b5 27.Qc3 Ra4 28.Rfl b4 29.axb4 Rxb4 30.Ral Rab8 31.Ra2 Rb3 32.Qd2 Re3 33.Qc2 c3 34.bxc3 Bxa2 35.Qxa2 Rxc3 36.Bg4 Re3 37.Be6 Rf8 38.Bd5 Kg7 39.Qa6 e6 40.Bxe6 fxe6 41 .Rxf8 Kxf8 42.Qc8+ Ke7 43.Qh7+ Nd7 44.Qa8 Rel+ 45.Kh2 Bgl+ 46.Khl Bd4+ 47.Kh2 Be5+ 48.g3 Re3, 0- 1. This was very advanced stuff, but it wasn't about calculation at all. Ultimately it came down to having faith in the power of \"lesser\" imbalances over material. PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 147 And this is a concept that you can (slowly but surely) train into your psyche at almost any rating level. Our next example shows a pawn sacrifice that directly addresses the imbal­ ances and goals that both sides were trying to achieve. W. Browne - J.

Quite simply, Black will have the advantage if he can find a safe haven for his King! Note how I didn't mention the threat of gxh6+. The reason is that one should have a firm grasp of the imbalances (and the goals that their existence creates) before thinking about threats and replies to them. Now that we know what both sides are trying to achieve (White wants to attack the enemy King, Black wants to find a safe home for it and then punish white's weak central pawns), the correct move for Black will make perfect sense. 23 ... Bg6! Played instantly (Browne hoped for 23 .. .hxg5 24.Qh5 when White's pieces are getting uncomfortably close to black's King). However, all of a sudden (af­ ter 23 ... Bg6) black's weak points (f7 is cemented and h5 is no longer a landing space for white's Queen) are solidly defended, and white's position begins to creak and whine. Why is 23 ... Bg6 a hard move to find? We've been conditioned to avoid losing material. In this case you are giving up a pawn with check, so the mind automati­ cally screams, \"Don't let him take it!\" and blinds you to all other possibilities. That's why creating an imbalance-oriented base of knowledge about every posi- 148 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION tion you reach is so important-knowing a position's priorities allows you to step beyond the emotive mind and make decisions where logic, not emotion, rules. 24.gxh6+ 24.b4 is answered by 24 ... Qxe5. 24 ... Kh7 White's a pawn ahead but the bits on e5, e4, and h6 are like overripe fruit that Black can pick whenever he wants to. Equally important is the black King's new situation-it's found some welcome cover on h7 and the white pawn on h6 actually plays the role of traitor since it's suddenly giving shelter to the opposing King. I felt very confident here, but both of us now had only 3 minutes to make 16 moves! 25.Bf4 Be7 The critical move (and my original intention) was 2 5 ... Rd4! 26.Be3 Rad8! 27.Bxd4 Rxd4 28.Radl Rxdl 29.Rxdl Qxe5 when Black has all the play. But h2-h4-h5 ghosts began to nag at me and, having no time for a deep look, ir­ rationality won out and I decided to stop the h-pawn in its tracks. I passed on 25 ... Nd7 due to 26.h4. 26.Rf2 Rd4 Going after the e5-pawn by 26 ... Nd7 !? was also tempting, but the clock was ticking and a decision had to be made! 27.Rg2 Rg8 28.Be3 Diagram 150 28 ... Qxe5?! I had been dying to sacrifice the Exchange all through this game, and now I jumped at the chance. However, this was not the best moment to do so, and the safer 28 ... Rd7 would have left Black firmly in charge since 29.Bf4 is strongly met by 29 ... Bf6! PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 149 29.Bxd4 Qxd4+ 30.Khl, 1/z-1/z. I had thought that I stood better here, but a quick look convinced me that things are actually far from clear: 30 ... Nxe4 (30 ... Kxh6 with an edge is best, but it didn't occur to me during the game) 31.Bd3 Nxc3 32.Bxg6+ Rxg6 33 .bxc3 Qxc3 34.Rfl Bf6 35 .Rxg6 Kxg6. With no time left, neither side wanted to touch this position! I should point out that offering various material imbalances is a part of many highly respected openings (we'll stress positional sacrifices here, and not attack­ based sacs). A few examples: The Stockholm Variation of the Classical l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be3 Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 Nc6 9.Nb3 Be6 10.f4 Na5 ll.f5 Bc4 12.Nxa5 Bxe2 13.Qxe2 Qxa5 14.g4 This position was once thought of as quite dangerous for Black, but when the discovery of 14 ... Rac8! 15.g5 Rxc3! 16.gxf6 Rxe3 17.Qxe3 Bxf6 hit the streets, the whole line was recognized as innocuous for White. Diagram 151 White to move Why is this acceptable for Black? Aside from the fact that he has a pawn for the Exchange (making the material investment minimal), white's King is also a bit insecure, black's Bishop is not only very active but also serves as a magnifi­ cent defender of its own King, and Black enjoys the superior pawn structure. Another problem for White concerns our eternal search for a plan. White has no play on the queenside or in the center, and aggressive posturing on the kingside will rarely work because the Bishop singlehandedly protects its King (an example of this will be given in the notes that follow). Black, however, can generate queenside play by the advance of his a- and b-pawns (a minority attack) and also place pressure on e4 ( ... Rc8-c4). All in all, it's thought to be equal but I consider it to be somewhat dreary for White. The game A. Filipowicz - A. Hollis, Marianske Lazni 1962 continued: 18.c3 Rc8 19.a3 Rc4 150 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION The e4-pawn is now under some heat. 20.Rael b5 Starting a classic minority attack.

Qc5, which only offers equality, was played in the actual game. Diagram 152 White's attack is an illusion 25.Rel 25.Qh6 looks scary, but Dragon players (and anyone that regularly fianchettos his kingside Bishop) know that it's very hard to mate a King when the defender's uncontested (White doesn't have a dark-squared Bishop to challenge it) dark­ squared Bishop defends g7 and h8. Mter 2 5 ... Rxe4! Black laughs at white's so-called attack since 26.Qh7 + Kf8 isn't anything for White, and 26.Rxf6 Rg4+ leaves White having to choose between 27 .Rg3 Rxg3 + 28.hxg3 exf6 (two pawns up for Black), and 27.Kfl Qhl+ with a winning attack for Black! The immediate 25.Rxf6 might seem to be a better move order, but this also fails: 25 ... Rxe4! 26.Rxg6+ (26.Qh6 Rg4+) 26 ... fxg6 27.Qg5 (2 7.Qh6 Rg4+) 27 ... Re6 and White's in serious trouble (2 8.Qh6? Qb6+ wins on the spot). 25 ... b4 26.axb4 axb4 and White is under severe pressure. His queenside is falling apart and, as we've seen, the attacking leap 27.Qh6 just doesn't get the job done. Catalan Opening One would think that many players with White (see diagram 15 3) would be delighted to achieve such a position by move 13 of the opening (the initial moves are l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2 dxc4 5.Nf3 c5 6.0-0 Nc6 7.Qa4 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qxd4 9.Bxc6+ Bd7 lO.Rdl Qxdl+ ll.Qxdl Bxc6 12.Qc2 Be7 PA RT FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 151 13.Qxc4 0-0). White has a Queen for black's Rook and Bishop, and all of white's pawns are healthy and his King is safe. So, why would anyone in his right mind actually play for this position as Black? Diagram 153 White to move Shockingly, world-class grandmaster Ulf Andersson often reached this position, which he considered to be a drawing line. And he proved it over and over by halving the point with many of the world's finest players (Kasparov included!). Why is Black okay here? Quite simply, his position is devoid of weaknesses, he's extremely solid, his c6-Bishop gives him ownership of the light squares, and White found it more or less impossible to tear down black's fortress. In other words, white's only favorable imbalance is his material advantage, and that alone isn't enough to generate any real winning chances. One sample (the game L. Polugaevsky - U. Andersson, Moscow 1981) is enough to show just how solid black's game is: 14.Nc3 Rfd8 15.Be3 Nd5 16.Nxd5 Bxd5 17.Qg4 Rdc8 18.Bd4 Bf8 19.e4 Bc6 20.h4 Rd8 21.Bc3 Rd3 22.h5 h6 23.Rel Rad8 24.Kh2 a6 25.Re2 Rdl 26.Rel Rld3 27.Re2 Bb5 28.Rc2 Ba4 29.b3 Bc6 30.Qf4 Bd6 31.Be5 Bf8 32.Bc3 Bd6, 1h-1h. Material sacrifices that create a \"battle of the imbalances\" are commonplace in virtually every opening. An excellent example of this is the highly popular Marshall Attack, which sees Black offering a pawn for a lead in development, active pieces, a slight weakening of the light squares in white's kingside, and good dynamic chances. On the other hand, White has a solid position and an extra pawn. R. Fischer - B. Spassky, 2nd Piatigorsky Cup 1966 l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Rel b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d5 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 ll.Rxe5 c6 152 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 154 In diagram 154, both sides have put their faith in their respective short and long term imbalances.

It's clear that black's compensation for the pawn isn't just a hope and a prayer­ it's based on sound positional considerations that last late into the game. One might wonder why everyone wouldn't play a line that gives Black a short-term attack and long-term positional compensation. The answer is that White has many ways to avoid falling victim to a fast mate, and though the resulting posi­ tions are often drawn, Black has to suffer a bit-perhaps not the kind of result keen PART FOUR I PS YCHO LOGICAL MEANDERINGS 153 attacking fans would dream of, but fully acceptable as far as theory is concerned. It must also be admitted that many players with the white pieces aren't too excited by those \"pleasant but probably not winning\" endgames. These unsat­ isfied souls constantly seek new ways to stir the pot. One sample: 12.d4 Bd6 13.Rel Qh4 14.g3 Qh3 15.Re4 g5 16.Qfl (Avoiding 16.Bxg5 ??

Diagram 156 White's now down an Exchange, but he has a pawn for it, a nice center, and two Bishops. Full compensation, but the chances are probably more or less balanced. There's no doubt that material is a major imbalance, with greed winning many games and also losing its share too. If you train yourself to view material as just another (albeit very important) imbalance, you'll open up a whole new level of understanding where sacrificing for tactical or positional compensation is always on the table. On the other hand, bravely taking everything your opponent of­ fers should also be a part of your overall mindset-in either case, the decision depends on a calm assessment of the imbalances that both sides end up with. 154 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Summary ' >'i ''?:>- How can a player get beyond his fear of parting with material? He has to train himself to view each imbalance as something important, and he has to view material as just another imbalance to be collected or rejected, depending on the nature of the individual position. � If you create \"imbalance vision\" and make the search for (and understanding of) imbalances an addiction, your playing strength will take a quantum leap forward. � Embrace your inner greed! Having a material advantage gives you a larger/more powerful army (which can translate to greater force being brought to a key sector of the board) and/or the long-term advantage of \"endgame odds\" (knowing that most endgames will win for the material up side grants him tremendous flexibility). So by all means, eat everything in your path, as long as you're aware of what (if anything) your opponent is getting in return. >; ,,,,g,;:o%,:!D:> If you read the board and decide that it's telling you to sacrifice material for a host of positional pluses, don't hesitate to do so! Learning to conquer your chess fears and prejudices is a huge part of improving your overall game. ''' \"' , D:> Being material ahead usually makes a player feel warm and fuzzy, but it's an imbalance and must be weighed against all the other imbalances. It might offer a decisive plus, or it might pale in comparison to different static or dynamic imbalances (compensation) in any given position. � Notice how sacrificing material and seeking material gains have been placed together. Both treat material as an imbalance (not something to be feared, avoided, worshipped, or always embraced), and the assessment of either decision (i.e., to take or to sacrifice) has to be based on the other imbalances on the board. PA RT FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS ISS Material - Tests Of all the test sections in this book, I think this one requires more from the reader than any other.

Decades of teaching have shown me that, when I ask my students why they did or didn't play a certain move, I usually get answers like, \"I can't do that because ... \" or \"I must play that because ... \" or \"I had to!\" or \"He has to!\" The highly destructive idea that you must do something you might not wish to do is so ubiquitous in amateur chess that I would say a player would gain at least a hundred rating points if he managed to rid himself of this one mental/ emotional curse. Let's take a look at the following position for a very basic example of what I'm talking about. Diagram 166 Black to move I've seen this kind of structure occur in countless amateur games, and far more often than you might imagine, the other side sets up a battery on the h3 -pawn via ...

And, over and over again, I've seen replies like 2.g4?? h5! 3.gxh5 Bxh3 when we've witnessed a self-fulfilling prophecy-white's kingside will be shattered and his worst nightmare will become a reality, or 2 .Kh2 ? when White has prevented ... Bxh3 but made a move he really had no intention of playing. PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 159 White's reactions were created by panic and, though he wasn't aware of it, he found himself manipulated like a puppet-his opponent (the puppet master) pulls a string and White finds that he no longer is in control of his own actions! Now we'll go back to 1 ... Qc8 and see how White should have reacted! Let's say White expected 1... b5 when he was going to reply with 2 .Bd3, while a quieter move by Black would have seen White respond with 2.a4, nipping black's queenside expansion in the bud. However, after l.. .Qc8 appeared on the board White immediately noted the intention of sacrificing on h3 . What should White do about this implied threat? The PHILOSOPHY Do you want to be the puppet or the puppet master? first thing you have to do is train your mind not to writhe in terror. Instead, heap scorn on your opponent's idea with a hearty (internal!) \"Rubbish!\" I'm serious! Whenever you see an enemy threat, your first thought should be \"Rubbish!\" though even stronger language can be used if you find it sets your thinking processes in the right direction! In general, a good player never accepts that an enemy threat will work unless he proves it to himself. In fact, his first impulse when seeing something like ... Qc8 is to break out in laughter or, at the very least, a smirk that says, \"You don't expect me to buy into that, do you?\" So, if you had intended to play 2.a4 against just about everything but 1 ... b5, then why not see if you can still play the desired move before looking for something else? The sequence then (physical moves and emotional! intellectual ruminations), will be something like this: l. .. Qc8 White: \"What utter Rubbish! Is this guy serious? I want to play 2.a4, and after 2 ... Bxh3 3.gxh3 Qxh3 something like 4.Nh2 (4.Ng5 is also good) followed by Qf3 seems to do the trick. Then I'm a piece up and should win the game.\" 2.a4 etc. As you saw, if Black goes ahead with the intended sacrifice White will have a material advantage and will be well on his way to victory. Thus, stopping a fake threat is akin to stopping your opponent from losing the game! Nobody (beginner or grandmaster) can afford to do that and expect good results. Of course, you have to prove the threat's ultimate worth before ignoring or preventing it. If it's really dangerous, you just shrug your shoulders and say, \"Hard to believe, but it seems to be true!\" Then you take a moment out to prevent his idea and continue on with your previous plans as soon as possible. The keys here are: __ .._ Never believe anything your opponent \"tells\" you. He's not your friend! This \"don't believe it until it's proven\" attitude is 160 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION a trained mental state-you are going to have to force yourself to enter that state by using the word \"Rubbish\" until it all becomes an unconscious process. __ .... You're the only advocate for your position. If you don't believe in it, who will? --.... If there's a move you really want to play, stick by it and see if that move will still work in the face of the supposed enemy threat. __ .... Train yourself to treat enemy threats with contempt, but don't be foolhardy! Always analyze the ramifications of allowing the threat before ignoring or preventing it. __ .... Remember, if you prevent a false threat, you are actually stopping your opponent from losing the game! Think about that-games are hard enough to win without you turning traitor and stopping the opponent from committing suicide! Training yourself to play the move you want to play, even in the face of a scary (but ultimately bogus) threat, will pay dividends in every kind of position. In a way, this philosophy should be looked upon as you demanding good things for your position-these \"good things\" won't be given to you, so you have to take them while the taking is good! l.Nf3 d5 2.d4 Nc6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Bf5 Diagram 167 White to move White's most natural move is 5.0-0, but black's last move not only developed his Bishop but also announced that 5 . .. Nb4 is in the air. \"Fear it! \" says Black. PART FOUR I PS YCHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 161 And many would do just that, renouncing the intended 5.0-0 for a bit of safety via 5 .a3 or 5 .c3-surely castling can follow once the danger is gone? IN A NUTSHELL Stopping a fake threat is akin to stopping your opponent from losing the game! But why should White waste a tempo to avoid the \"danger?\" I constantly tell my students that, \"Every move is like gold. Moves are a very valuable com­ modity and you don't want to waste them!\" So, though both 5 .a3 and 5 .c3 are playable, are you really getting top value for your gold plated move? Obviously not! Instead, try to make the most valuable move (the move you feel the position really needs) work. 5.0-0! PHILOSOPHY It's what you wanted to do, so do it! 5 ... Nb4 6.c3 !? White can now defend c2 with 6.Na3 (White's most popular choice) or by 6.Nel. Every move is like gold. Moves are a very valuable commodity and you don't want to waste them! However, 6.c3 demonstrates that black's \"threat\" of ... Nb4 was certainly noth- ing to waste a move preventing! 6 ... Nc2? Actually 6 ... Bc2 ! is best, when 7.Qe1 Nc6 leads to some strange abnormali­ ties (the black Knight didn't accomplish much, and his light-squared Bishop is also oddly placed, but white's Queen is far from ideal on e1), while 7 .Qd2 Bxb 1 8.a3 ! Be4 9.axb4 is only slightly better for White. 7.Nh4 Nxal 8.Nxf5 and Black, whose a1 -Knight is trapped on a1 and will certainly die there, is in serious trouble. So far we've seen that \"I can't\" gets its power from one side believing his own propaganda (\"My move is strong, fear it!\") and the other bowing to the opponent's certainty-he tells you (silently ... almost psychically) that doing what you want to do is no longer possible because of the threat he just created. One of the most common situations for brain-melt occurs when one side is quite a bit higher rated than the other. In that case the lower rated player is expecting to lose from move one and, when things get tough, he fully accepts the self-fulfilling prophecy of doom. For example, I once witnessed a game where a grandmaster was playing a 21 00 rated opponent. The grandmaster was doing well when he suddenly \"hung\" a piece. The 21 00 looked at it for a long time-to take or not to take? Obviously the grandmaster wouldn't just give a piece away, so it had to be a trap-the grandmaster was clearly saying, \"You'll die a horrible death if you dare touch that piece.\" Eventually the 21 00 thought he saw something that might be dangerous and didn't accept the gift. The grandmaster won easily. 162 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION After the game the grandmaster asked, \"Why didn't you take my piece? I would have resigned if you did!\" Ah, if only Mr. 21 00 had screamed (internally) \"Rubbish! I'm going to snap that piece off and force him to show me why I can't!\" This story illustrated a one-way delusion-his fear and paranoia combined to create shadows and evil intent that only existed in his own mind. Just as com­ mon, though, is a situation where the superior player believes something that's completely wrong but his air of confidence (and those extra rating points!) quickly convinces the lower rated opponent to dance cheek to cheek down delusion lane. This \"propaganda + rating points = mutual delusion\" theorem can be seen in our next example. Diagram 168 A. Uto (1 630) - C. Lamprey (1 882), Paris Club Match 2009 White to move Earlier in the game White had achieved an easily drawn position that was devoid of any danger. However, the higher rated player (Black) outplayed his opponent and achieved some serious-looking kingside threats thanks to his pressure against h4 and his hyperactive King ( ... Kg4 hitting h4 with a possible ... Kf3 if f2 is left unattended). Black was suddenly looking extremely confident and White realized that she had screwed things up. Staring in horror at the mess she had made, she forgot about the clock and her flag fell, thus handing Black the victory that he assured her (after the score sheets were signed) would have been his even if the game had continued. The next day I got a copy of the game, which ended with the following com­ ment by Miss Uta: \"My flag fell, but I can't draw this anyway.\" The higher rated player's \"handing down truth\" made such a profound impression that she didn't bother challenging his comment and she would have continued to believe it if I didn't immediately e-mail back, \"What are you talking about? This is a dead draw. In fact, you should easily draw Kasparov here.\" PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL ME ANDERING$ 163 And, finally, she did the right thing and challenged my statement. And this leads us to an important rule: Always challenge everything until you have, to the best of your ability, proven or disproven the other person's view. By doing so, you will build correct mental/emotional habits and also learn a lot by forcing yourself to peer as deeply into a situation as you can. So, how could White have saved the game? Was it really so easy? Yes it was! All she had to do was play the Bishop back and forth to d8 and e7 (tying the black King to the defense of f6) and it would be time to split the point (if Black moved his King back to e6 White would stick the Bishop on d8 and then dance about with her King). Of course, it's clear that a couple things combined to put White over the edge. The \"propaganda + rating points = mutual delusion\" theorem was one of the main culprits, but White was also guilty of concentrating on black's threats (a failing we saw in diagram 166) and didn't even consider that she could create her own. The Eerie Phenomenon of Mutual Delusion The examples that follow show that delusion and \"I can't\" (as in Uta's \"I can't defend this\" and her opponent's \"She can't defend this\") occur in every possible situation: grandmasters fall victim to it, equally matched players do the same dance of madness, and on and on it goes! In Kotov's classic book Think Like a Grandmaster, he gave an example of this kind of mutual delusion, though in that case he was using it in a discussion about blunders. However, let's look beyond the blunder and try and understand why this particular kind of mistake is made. Diagram 169 A. Ebralidze - V. Ragozin, Tbilisi 193 7 Black to move Black's a pawn up but his Bishop is pinned, his Rook is under attack, and his a 7 -pawn is also threatened. 164 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION l. .. Rc7?? In one sense this is the perfect solution! It saves the Rook, defends the a 7 -pawn, threatens white's Rook, and tries to trade into a winning pawn up Bishop vs. Knight endgame after 2 .Rxc7 Bd6+ forking the Rook and King. Nice! The only problem is that after 2.Rxc7 Bd6+ is illegal since the Bishop is pinned! Ragozin had simply forgotten about the pin, but he was 100% sure that if White captured on c7 he would achieve a winning endgame. And, as a result of this knowing that 2.Rxc7 was just what he wanted White to do, the illusion wafted across the board to his opponent. Ebralidze, of course, fully understood his opponent's idea (\"He wants me to take it when ... Bd6+ leaves me with a lost endgame.\") and thus succumbed to a form of Vulcan mind meld-he saw what Black saw, knew what Black knew, and felt the certainty that Black undoubtedly felt. And so it came to pass that both players were in complete agreement that 2.Rxc7 led to a lost endgame for White. It's interesting to note that a member of the audience became so agitated that Ebralidze wasn't devouring the gift and winning the game that he screamed, \"Archil, take his Rook!\" Poor Ebralidze, completely immersed in black's reality, gave the fool in the audience an angry glance (No doubt thinking, \"I can't take it you idiot! Aren't you even good enough to see such a basic Bishop fork? \") and retreated his Rook from d7 to d5. The ultimate irony is that he ended up falling for the very thing he feared most-the Bishop forking his Rook and King: 2.Rd5?? Bf6 3.Nb5 Rc2+ 4.Kg3 a6 5.Rd7+ Ke8 6.Rc7 Be5+, 0- 1. What we have here isn't a blunder created by flawed calculation-instead it's a picture perfect but extreme case of \"falling under the spell\" of the opponent's dementia. A kind of mass hallucination! I loved this story when I first read Kotov's book, but it seemed a bit farfetched to me. But, as fate would have it, I experienced almost the exact same thing while coaching the American junior team with Pal Benko in Szeged, Hungary. Diagram 170 Nguyen Anh Dung -]. Waitzkin, Szeged 1994 White to move PART FOUR I PS YCHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 165 Since coaches were not allowed in the playing hall for fear that they would speak to players, Benko and I were watching from way up above in the balcony. Black has just played his Queen to g2 , checking white's King. lt's clear that Black has a big advantage and we were sure Josh was going to win this game. Mter giving the check, he only had five minutes for the next few moves, but surely that would prove to be more than enough? 1.Qf2 We had expected I.Qxg2 Rxg2 + 2.Kd3 (2 .Kd l puts up a better fight) 2 ... Rf2 3.Rxh5+ Kg7 4.Rh3 b5 when white's in zugzwang and has to give up material: 5.Rhl Rxf3 + 6.Kd2 Kg6 and Black should score the full point-7.Rh8 Kf5 8.Rc8 Rfl 9.Rxc6 Ra l 10.Rb6 a4 ll .Rxb5 Ke4 12 .Rb8 f3 13 .Rf8 Rxa3. However, I.Qf2 seemed odd. How did we miss it? Then reality hit us both in the face-this simply hangs the hl -Rook! Of course, it was clear that White wasn't aware hl was floating in the breeze, no doubt feeling that it was defended a moment ago and so \"Black still can't take it.\" Good news for us since now, after the obvious 1 ... Qxhl, White would resign and we could begin looking at the games of our other players. But no-instead of snapping off the free Rook (followed by ... Rg2 to boot), Josh sank into deep thought. In fact, he seemed disturbed by I.Qf2-for some reason he thought this wasn't possible (just like our initial reaction!) and RULE Always challenge everything until you have, to the best of your ability, proven or disproven the other person's view. couldn't understand why it was now staring him in the face! One minute ticked by, then two, and it became clear that Josh had bought into white's \"he can't take the Rook\" (which translates into black's \"I can't\") delusion. Naturally we were both freaking out from our perch, and after a third min­ ute passed, Benko started muttering, \"Take the Rook! Why isn't he taking the Rook? \" I told him to be quiet, but another thirty seconds went by (leaving Josh with just ninety seconds) and Pal, who had lost all control, started raising his voice as he repeated the Rook mantra, \"Take the Rook! Why can't he take the Rook? \" Of course, the arbiters would not take kindly to the coaches sharing this kind of information, so I quickly grabbed Benko and dragged him away from our scene of anguish. After using up all but a minute (Black was clearly wondering, \"How did I miss this defense?\"), Josh finally played l.. .Qg6 and after 2.Kd2 Qf5 3.Rh4 Rg5 4.Kcl Qg6 5.Qh2 Kg8 he was once again winning and soon scored the full point: 6.Qd2 Rg2 7.Qd3 Qg5 8.Rh3 h4 9.Kb2 Rg3 10.Rh2 h3 ll.c4 dxc4 12.Qxc4 Qf5 13.Qe2 Kf7 14.Qel Rg2, 0- 1. As you can see, if the opponent's delusion can create \"I can't\" so powerfully that you aren't able to see a one move snatch of a hanging Rook, imagine how 166 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION easy it is to buy into something believable, like a threat. That's why you have to use the \"Rubbish!\" prompt when an enemy threat appears. And if the opponent plays a move that you never imagined (e.g. l.Qf2 in the Waitzkin game), instead of allowing yourself to get confused, seek instant clarity by asking, \"How can I punish this?\" The logic is clear: if you didn't anticipate his response, then it must be bad and thus deserves to be punished! This is a much healthier mindset than seeing an unexpected move and thinking, \"I missed it! I must be doomed! \" Once again, both \"Rubbish!\" and \"How can I punish this?\" are positive prompts that set an upbeat tone and allow you to see through the opponent's haze. Start training yourself to use them right away! When you accept \"I can't\" into your chess life (okay, you shouldn't accept it into any part of your life, but that's way off topic), you'll find that various missed opportunities litter your games. Diagram 171 R. Crotto - M. Lazarevic, Rio de Janeiro 1979 White to move Aside from the fact that black's a pawn up, White also saw that ... R8b3 was coming. Since ... R8b3 followed by ... Rh3 mate seems impossible to stop, Crotto bowed to the god of \"I can't\" (as in, \"I can't do anything about it\") and resigned. However, if you have plenty of time left for thought, why tip your King when you can calmly look at the board for something/anything that might offer some hope? The old saying, \"Nobody ever won a game by resigning\" is hard to argue with, so why not use that clock time to seek a miracle? Consider this: if you had a pack of 20 rabid dogs just a minute away from your throat and your only means of \"escape\" appeared to be leaping several hundred yards onto the jagged rocks below, what would you do? Leap? Lie down and wait to die? Weep until the dogs put you out of your misery? Or, would you use every second of your final bit of time trying your best to figure out some mind-bending way to save your skin? PART FOUR I PS YCHOLO GICAL MEANDERINGS 167 In chess, you need to put that same emotional burst of energy into hard­ to-defend positions as you would a life and death situation. If you think, \"I'm doomed\" (an offshoot of \"I can't\"), then you will be doomed. Crotto chose the \"doom\" scenario, but it turns out that salvation was there, just waiting to be discovered: l.h3! Rbb3 This is the move that convinced Crotto to give up all hope and resign (it does look bad!). Oddly, better is l.. .Ra2 2.Rcc7 Rf8 3.Rc6 Ra5 4.Rcxa6 Rxe5, but Black would have little hope of success after 5 .Re7 Re4 6.Raa7. 2.Rc8+ Kg7 3.Rg8+! Kxg8 4.Ra8+ Kg7 5.Rg8+! Kxg8, 1/z-112.

Perhaps part of the fear of opening up her King was caused by her op­ ponent's strength-Israeli grandmaster Ronen Har-Zvi is a very tough cus- 168 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION tomer! However, if you find yourself playing both the board and a rating, you're pretty much up the creek. It's interesting to note that chess is very much a caste system. I remember one tournament where I entered an eleva­ tor and, as the door closed, some guy squeezed in. He asked if I was Jeremy Silman, I said yes, shook his hand, and said, \"It's a pleasure meeting you. What's your name?\" His reply stunned me: \"Oh, you don't want to know my name, my rating is too low!\" Though this was shocking, I had actually experienced the whole \"caste game\" earlier in my career. When I was a child and just starting out (with a 1068 rating), players 1400 and above pretty much steered clear of me-l just wasn't strong enough to hang with them. And when I had an expert rating a few years later, I vividly recall watching a couple of strong masters enjoying some five-minute chess in between rounds at a tournament in Salt Lake City. I asked if I could play the winner, and the stronger of the two said, \"Sorry, but I only play people that are good!\" Those ratings hold a lot of power in chess, and I think just about every player is vulnerable to \"rating fear\" (a serious disease that only affects chess addicts). When I was rated in the 1800s, I had a terrible time dealing with those 2000+ gods. As soon as I saw a rating of 2000 or higher I would freeze and lose like a lamb. Finally I had had enough and decided to only look at an opponent's rat­ ing after the game was over. I implemented this in my very next tournament and was quickly paired with some guy that I wasn't familiar with. I didn't know his rating but, after a dozen moves, came to the conclusion that he was in the 1600-1 800 range. I wiped him out and was stunned to discover that he was rated 2182! Mter that, I lost my fear of experts (2000 to 21 99)-it was no lon­ ger a matter of numbers; I firmly believed they weren't a threat and that belief propelled me past them. There's absolutely no doubt that confidence plays a huge role in chess. Those who are paired with a higher rated player and think, \"I'm doomed,\" will find that the evisceration that follows will be quick and quite painful. On the other hand, the guy who revels in the pairing against a higher rated opponent and honestly feels he will crush his egotistical foe usually has quite a few scalps on his wall. This is why an unproven \"I can't\" is such a crippling mindset. You are giving power to your own insecurity and to your opponent, and that alone makes you a huge underdog in the coming battle. If girl-brain hadn't been facing a chess titan, perhaps she would have tried to prove/ disprove her initial feeling that 18 ... Qxd5 (The move Black wants to play since the Queen is beautifully placed on d5 and the d4-pawn will prove to be a permanent target-remember, if there's a move you want to play, try hard to PART FOUR I PS YCHOLO GICAL MEANDERINGS 169 make it work!) 19.Nxf6+ gxf6 was too risky. And, in doing so, she might have realized that Black actually has an excellent game. Let's look at a few examples after 20.Qh5 (not good, but it's the kind of thing that would scare an \"I can't\" addict into not entering this as Black) 20 ... Kh7 (defending h6 and preparing to make use of the g-file with ... Rg8): Diagram 173 21 .Bd2 leaves Black with a comfortable edge after 21 ... Rg8 22 .g3 Rg6. 21.Be3 ??

As you can see, Black would have had a lot of fun with 18 ... Qxd5, but she con­ vinced herself that she couldn't do it and thus potential fun turned into misery. 19.Qf3 This forces the win of a pawn (after 19 ... h5 20.Qxf5 hxg4 21.Qxg4), though Black will (luckily) be able to claim some compensation for it. Nevertheless, Black, who didn't intend to lose material and had lost all confidence in herself, completely fell apart and lost quickly. In general, an \"I can't\" moment is rarely based on any profound considerations. You glance at a logical possibility, emotion takes over and screams the \"I can't\" refrain, and you do something that has little to do with the needs of the posi­ tion. This happens all the time and the only cure is to insist on finding a way 170 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION to make the desired move work.

Here Black played 22 ... fS?! when after 2 3 .Bd3 his Rooks weren't nearly as active as they could have been after the more natural and far stronger 22 ... Rc2 . During a lesson, I asked Jeremy Stein (who was a strong expert at this time) why he didn't bring his Rook to its 7th rank and he said, \"I intended to do that but then I saw 23 .Bd3 . I realized that l couldn't play 22 ... Rc2 so I gave 22 .. .fS a try. \" In black's mind, the mere sight of a developing move that simultaneously at­ tacked a Rook caused him to instantly label the move he wanted to play as bad. Instead of analyzing the position after 22 ... Rc2 2 3 .Bd3 and trying to see what was really going on, he dropped 22 ... Rc2 like a hot potato. In fact, he tried to put 22 ... fS on the board so we could look at the game continuation but I placed the f-pawn back on f6 and said, \"Show me why 22 ... Rc2 23 .Bd3 Rxb2 or 23 ... Rxg2 isn't just very pleasant for you.\" He quickly agreed that it was far superior to the move played. Then I added, \"Jeremy, do you see what's happening here? I'm defending the move you wanted to play. Why didn't you defend it in the game?\" To be fair to Mr. Stein, everyone of every rating falls victim to thoughts like \"I can't\" and \"I have to\". The difference is, though grandmasters occasionally cave in to its influence, amateurs are universally enslaved by it!

Our next example shows a World Champion falling victim to this disease. Diagram 175 Em. Lasker - M. Euwe, Nottingham 1936 Black to move Black has a small but permanent edge thanks to his superior pawn structure and total control over the d5 -square. Black, whose Knight is under attack, should play the obvious 1 ... Nb6 followed by 2 ... Nd5 when White would have to defend for a long time in order to earn a draw. Instead, something strange occurred. l. ..Ba5?? Very odd. Black is saying, \"You have to move your Knight or take on c4 and allow a trade.\" Of course, \"You have to\" drinks from the same cup of laziness as \"I can't.\" Yes, it's possible that White does indeed have to move it (though it wouldn't bother him if he did), but when you have a Knight hanging out to dry (White's itching to play Kxc4) you better be sure \"you have to\" is 100% accurate! 2.b4! Euwe must have experienced that \"I'm going to throw up\" feeling after this appeared on the board and reality came crashing down on his head. Both black pieces are now attacked, so the Bishop has to capture on b4. 2 ... Bxb4 3.Nc2 The point. By sacrificing the b-pawn, White lured the Bishop to b4 where it would be in striking range of the Knight. After 3 .N c2 Black loses a piece and eventually lost the game. In general, \"I can't\" or \"He has toll have to\" appears due to: Lack of proper concentration. Bad mental habits. Allowing emotion to override logic. 172 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDIT ION Not being strong enough to prove whether or not an \"I can't\" or \"He has to\" is actually correct. We all run into situations that are above our level, and there's no shame in that (such moments can act as wonderful learning tools). A lack of concentration can occur due to some outside influence (for example, you were just told that you're going to be audited) or you are just having a \"bad hair day.\" We can't prevent negative biorhythms or some personal Apocalypse from smacking us down from time to time, but we can work on improving concentration, quieting an overly emotional mind, and most definitely fixing mental habits that only lead to anguish. If you want to defeat \"I can't\" then you simply must make use of the \"Rub­ bish!\" tool. In fact, challenge every quiet command (you saying \"I can't\", your opponent saying \"You have to\", etc.) that comes your way. To succeed in this, you have to go over your games from the last several months and look for the moments where things went sour. A computer will help you find those tactical moments, while a teacher will help you with the positional meltdowns. And, in both cases, you'll find that a large percentage of your \"slips\" were caused by some form of mental surrender. The only way to fix this problem is to be introduced to its existence (which we're doing here), to find instances of it in your own games (thus personalizing it), and then to use the \"Rubbish!\" tool to train you to stop and challenge every negative thought that your own brain or your opponent tosses your way. Summary ====> Whenever you see an enemy threat, your first thought should be \"Rubbish!\" though even stronger language can be used if you find it sets your thinking processes in the right direction! ====> In general, a good player never accepts that an enemy threat will work unless he proves it to himself. In fact, his first impulse when seeing a blatant threat like ... Qc8 is to break out in laughter or, at the very least, a smirk that says, \"You don't expect me to buy into that, do you?\" ====> If you prevent a false threat, you are (in many cases) actually stopping your opponent from losing the game! Think about that-games are hard enough to win without you turning traitor and stopping the opponent from committing suicide. i l PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 173 ===::::::::> Never believe anything your opponent \"tells\" you. He's not your friend! This \"don't believe it until it's proven\" attitude is a trained mental state-you are going to have to force yourself to enter that state by using the word \"Rubbish\" until it all becomes an unconscious process. ===::::::::> You're the only advocate for your position. If you don't believe in it, who will? ===::::::::> If there's a move you really want to play, stick by it and see if that move will still work in the face of the supposed enemy threat. ===::::::::> Train yourself to treat enemy threats with contempt, but don't be foolhardy! Always analyze the ramifications of allowing the threat before ignoring or preventing it. ===::::::::> Every move is like gold. Moves are a very valuable commodity and you don't want to waste them! ===::::::::> Always challenge everything until you have, to the best of your ability, proven or disproven the other person's view. By doing so, you will build correct mental/emotional habits and also learn a lot by forcing yourself to peer as deeply into a situation as you can. ===::::::::> If the opponent plays a move that you never imagined, instead of allowing yourself to get confused, seek instant clarity by asking, \"How can I punish this?\" The logic is clear: if you didn't anticipate his response, then it must be bad and thus deserves to be punished! This is a much healthier mindset than seeing an unexpected move and thinking, \"I missed it! I must be doomed!\" 174 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Mental Breakdown - Tests These problems will test your ability to see beyond chess illusion, and beyond fear.

In a way, this is an extension of the \"negative\" Mental Breakdown chapter. Though we will still be exploring the \"I can't\" and \"rubbish!\" mentality, our main focus will be on pushing one's own agenda. Thus, mantras such as \"I will find a way! \" and \"I must! \" take precedence here. While the previous chapter brought the problems of mental domination/ supplication to light, and hopefully, made you aware that this is something that affects everyone on some level, this chapter rams home the need for a positive mindset. And, in turn, a positive \"I'll do what I want no matter what you say\" psychological/emotional state often leads to degrees of mental domination that you might never have thought possible. Personally, I've had hundreds of games where my opponent begins to react to me. He is usually unaware of his sudden, extremely subtle defensive demeanor, but once I sense this-even though the position is completely equal-I become sure that he's on his way down and that victory will eventually be mine. Chess writers have traditionally used the word initiative when a player is taking control of the game's tempo, but I vastly prefer the psychologically charged mantras I'm using here. One side makes a move that pushes his agenda, PHILOSOPHY You will gain huge dividends by creating an 'Til do what I want no matter what you say\" attitude in chess. � the other side reacts, and a note appears that says, \"White has now taken the initiative.\" However, most players don't really understand what that means, and therefore don't know how to make use of it in any practical sense. What good is a term, even one that's constantly used, if its real meaning remains a mystery to the vast majority of chess fans? Because of this, I use that term sparingly, and instead tend to explain a situation where one side succeeds in pushing his agenda with words that can be understood, and that teach. And why not-I consider the initiative to be a physical manifestation of a psycho­ logical battle; both sides champion their view of things in the hope that the opponent will have to eventually forgo his own plans and react to yours. Make PART FOUR I PS YCHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 177 no mistake about it, macho chess-pushing one's own agenda and mantras such as \"rubbish\", \"I will find a way\", \"I must\" and \"I'll do what I want no matter what you say\" -is all about the initiative, and a player's ability and desire to take iron control over a game! The following game, played online at a slow time control by Mr. Hubbard (a skilled positional player) and Mr. Abraham (a man who obviously enjoyed a good slugfest), caught my attention in a big way. On move eight White played to make castling difficult for his opponent to achieve. Instead of backing down, Black punched right back, trying to impose his will on White! Though Black was outplayed, we have to salute his \"glass overflowing at all times\" attitude. Q. Hubbard (1998) -Abraham (1720), ICC 2005 l.Nf3 Nc6 2.d4 e5 3.dxe5 Qe7 4.g3 Nxe5 5.Bg2 c6 6.0-0 Nf6 7.b3 g6 Diagram 182 White to move 8.Qd4 White obviously felt that Black, with his King sitting in the center, needed to be punished. Though this isn't by any means the only move, I would never criticize a student for trying to impose his will on the opponent! Of course, both 8.c4 and 8.Bb2 were good alternatives. Here's a quick look at 8.Bb2 and the kind of slow but effective positional play that might result: 8 ... Nxf3 + (8 ... d6 9.Nxe5 dxe5 10.Nd2 with the idea of Nc4 is good for White) 9.exf3 ! d5 lO.Rel Be6 ll .Nc3 Bg7 12 .Ne2 !

You don't have to go berserk trying to knock a guy out! Yes, if the opportunity arises, take it, but in most cases calmly pushing your positional/tactical agenda in a logical fashion will get the job done. \"Macho chess\" should also be logical, imbalance-oriented chess! 178 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION 8 ... d6 8 ... Nxf3+!? was a good alternative. 9.Rdl 9.Nxe5!? was also possible, but 9.Rd l continues white's efforts to make his opponent bend to his will. Now d6 is under pressure and 9 ... Bg7 is impossible. 9 ... Bg7!? Maybe it's not impossible after all! Black refuses to obey and offers up the d-pawn in an act of commendable defiance. Instead, 9 ... Nxf3+!? was interesting: 10.Bxf3 Bg7 ll.c3 0-0 12.Qxd6 Qxd6 13.Rxd6 Bf5 14.Be3 Rfe8 with compensa­ tion for the sacrificed pawn. 10.Nxe5 10.Qxd6?? Qxd6 ll .Rxd6 Ne4 would have led to some horrible blow along the al -h8 diagonal. However, after 10.Nxe5 it's clear that Black has two pos­ sible moves: 10 ... dxe5 and 10 ... Qxe5-White would retain some advantage in both cases. Diagram 183 Black to move 10 ... Nd7!?? I said Black had \"two possible moves\" and he tossed out a third! The move is a blunder, but I have to admire this guy's spirit! He refuses to be bullied, even if it means committing ritualistic seppuku. \"I can't\" or \"I have to\" doesn't exist in Mr. Abraham's vocabulary! At this point White had to make a big decision: back off and settle for a small plus, or put his brain into hyper-drive and insist on finding something crushing. In the actual game, Mr. Hubbard couldn't deal with the heat down the al-h8 diagonal-he blinked, unconsciously muttered, \"I can't refute your move\" and then played 11.c3. There followed ll .. .Bxe5 (1 l ... dxe5 12 .Qe3 0-0 13 .Ba3 forces Black to give up the d5-square by 13 ... cS when 14.c4 followed by Nc3 is very PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGIC AL MEANDERINGS 179 strong for White) 12.Qd2 Nb6?

Though \"death by diagonal\" seems to be staring you in the face (with all sorts of \"I can't and \"I must\" thoughts zipping through your neurons), White can punish his opponent's hubristic 10 ... Nd7 only by staring down the barrel of the diagonal gun: ll.Nxc6! Bxd4 12.Nxe7 Bxal and, after a few forced moves, we come to a split: Diagram 184 White to move 13.Nd5 0-0 14.c3 Nb6 15.Nc7 Rb8 16.Bh6 Rd8 17.Bg5 and Black is in serious trouble. 13.Nxc8!

Finding the refutation to black's outrageous 10 ... Nd7 called for a certain at­ titude, the determination of a wronged man, and more than a little courage. If you begin with \"I can't\" or any kind of fear, then the mental/emotional battle is over before it begins. Here's a simpler (and amusing!) example of a blitz game where White gives his opponent a tiny push, and Black responds by running him over. A-meise - Gerard Sorme, ICC 3-0, 2008 l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 e6 4.Bxc6 bxc6 5.0-0 d5 6.d3 Ne7 7.Nc3 Ng6 8.Qe2 Be7 9.Rbl 0-0 10.b3 Ba6 ll .Na4 c4!? 12.dxc4 dxc4 13.Rdl? 180 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N Diagram 185 Black to move White should have played 13 .Nb2 Qc7 14.Nxc4 Rfd8 15.Bb2 e5 16.Bc3 f6 17 .Rfd 1 Nf4 and Black's active pieces and two Bishops give him some compen­ sation for the sacrificed pawn. However, White felt that he might as well attack black's Queen with his Rook and get a \"free\" move in. 13 ... cxb3 ! Why move the Queen when Black can make his own threats instead? 14.c4? One can imagine White thinking, \"Okay, now move your Queen!\" 14 ... Bxc4! Black's verbal reply would go something like, \"Me, move my Queen and do what you want me to do? No way!\" With 14 ... Bxc4, Black still ignores his op­ ponent while feasting on white bits. This is even stronger than 14 ... bxa2, which was played in the actual game (Black won in 19 moves). 15.Qel White: \"Okay, now you simply must move that Queen!\" Better (but still bad) was 15.Rxd8 Bxe2 16.Rxa8 Rxa8 17.axb3 (17.Rxb3 Bd1) 17 ...

Black: \"Why move my Queen when there are pawns to eat and egos to shred?\" 16.Ral Qb8 and, with this move, we once again enter the reality where Queens have to move when they are attacked. Sadly for White, it's not a very happy reality at all-he's three pawns down and completely lost. PART FOUR I PS YCHOLO GICAL ME ANDERINGS 181 As is always the case, these ideas affect players of every level. Our next game shows two legends having at it, with the ever-aggressive Marshall asking Capa­ blanca how he intends to defend d3 (a \"you have to\" moment). J. Capablanca - F.

The ability to laugh at your opponent's threats while also seeking the very best for your own position is a huge one. In fact, let's up the voltage a bit and PHILOSOPHY If your opponent sends a subliminal \"you have to\" command, challenge it and let him know that the only agenda that's going to be pushed is yours. change \"seeking\" to \"insisting\" ! Most players, when faced with a tough decision, spend a couple min­ utes looking for the perfect move and then, having failed to find it, play something else that doesn't get the job done. That is not insisting! Of course, in many positions several different moves will do, but there usually comes a time when one particular move is needed to win or hold life and limb together. In that case, you must find it! The following example shows just such a case. PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 183 Diagram 188 T. Nyback - E. Agrest, Stockholm 2001 Black to move White's Queen is attacking both the c8-Rook and the a6-pawn. Since losing the Rook would be suicide, losing the a6-pawn appears to be unavoidable. Many players would accept this and most likely draw the game, but the correct mental stance would be to demand a solution from yourself-\"! must defend both units or create play elsewhere that will sidetrack him! I must!\" Once you realize that this is the major decision of the game (i.e., you lose back your extra pawn or you retain it), you should be motivated to put every last ounce of energy into finding the solution to your problem. And, if it turns out that there wasn't a solution to be found, or that the answer was beyond your level, don't feel bad-as long as you recognized the moment's importance and tried as hard as you could to solve it, there is no reason not to feel happy with yourself. In this particular position, Black found the right way to proceed. l.. .Qc4! A nice move that defends a6, defends c8, and also creates a nasty little threat that White completely missed. 2.Qxb6?? White snaps while the snapping is good, but this obvious capture loses im­ mediately. White needed to settle down and process all the things that black's move does. Once he understood that ... Qh4+ was a devastating threat, he would be in the same \"must find\" situation that Black was a moment before. Then it would be up to White to hunker down and find the best way to put up resistance. White's assessment of the position's needs is fairly straightforward: ... Qh4+ is a deathblow, and a quiet defensive move like 2.g3 allows Black to consolidate with 2 ... Rc6 (even better is 2 ... Qe6 when 3.Qxa6 fails to 3.. .Qh3) 3.Qb8+ Kg7 4.Qe5+ Rf6. So White needs to avoid the big threat and try and create some counterplay at the same time (since black's two connected passed queenside pawns will kill him if he fails to do so). 184 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION If White wants counterplay, he needs to get his Rook into the action. Thus 2.Rd2 (which also gives white's King access to e2 in case of a check on h4) makes a lot of sense. Now 2 ... Rc6 doesn't have the desired effect: 3 .Qb8+ Kg7 4.Qe5+ Rf6 5.Rd6 Qc2+ 6.Kg3 Qf5 7.Qd4 and White is doing very well. So, after 2.Rd2 Qh4+ is still the best move: 3.Ke2 Re8 4.Qxb6 Qxh2 5.Kf2 Qh4+ 6.Ke2 and though Black is obviously better, White is still hanging on and forcing his op­ ponent to work hard for the win. 2 ... Qh4+, 0- 1. Clearly, a \"must find the best move\" mentality in critical posi­ tions is useful both in attack and defense. At the highest levels of the game, both sides consistently push their own agendas with an unerring singleness of purpose. And, more often than not, when one side \"blinks\" and accepts that the opponent's ideas are better than his, the blinker quickly finds his position sliding into oblivion. V. Kramnik - M.

By depriving Black of his dreamed of ... c7-c5 advance (which would eradicate his weaknesses and free his pieces), White maintains a firm grip on the queenside. White refused to bow to his opponent's will and instead pressed ahead with his own agenda. However, wouldn't most players be transfixed by the loss of the b4-pawn? The only way someone can get beyond the \"I can't let PART FOUR I PSY CHOL OGI CAL MEANDERINGS 185 him win a pawn\" mentality is if they train themselves to see imbalances (like space and control over advanced squares) as being just as important (depending on the position, of course!) as material. 17 ... axh4 1 8.Na5 Ba8 19.Nac6 Giving up the b-pawn (whose purpose was to prevent ... c7 -c5) has given White the time to get his rather unimposing d2 -Knight to the hole on c6.

You can begin to develop it at any level by training yourself to highlight your position's favorable imbalances while refusing to cave in to your opponent's at­ tempts to turn your head to his way of looking at things. This training can be done by studying grandmaster games and getting a feel for the way the chess gods always stress the positive aspects of their game, and/or you can (and should!) practice this in your own games (tournament or blitz!), making sure that every game you play is a live lesson in positive cues like \"Rubbish!\" \"I must find the best move!\" \"I will make full use of the positive imbalances in my position!\" \"It's my party and I'll do what I want to!\" and other nuggets of that nature. Yes, it will go horribly wrong from time to time, but that's how you learn. When you get nuked (which is inevitable-it happens to everybody), get up, wipe away the radioactive dust, and try again and again and again.

PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL ME ANDERINGS 187 The kind of move that's perfect for blitz-good or bad, White is striving to redefine the position on his own terms. Note what is going on: Black was try­ ing to tell White that the loose pawns on b2 and e4 were the factors that re­ ally mattered in the position. He wanted White to agree and begin to defend. Instead, White pointed to d6 and insisted that this was more important than b2 and e4. Now it was up to Black to get a grip on the position and find a way to challenge White again. 16 ... Qxe4??

Ker Positions We've all seen notes to a game where the annotator says, \"This is the key position.\" But, what exactly is a key position? A key position is, in my view, a very personal thing-while one player might see a particular situation as a key position that demands a huge effort to solve, another will see the same position as easy and thus not important at all. A position is only \"key\" if you sense that the correct move or plan will have a major impact on the game, but the right move or plan isn't clear to you. Of course, this takes us back to mental toughness and the mindset of insist­ ing on solving an over-the-board problem that you deem important. Semantics isn't important during a heated battle, though understanding the concept of a \"key position\" can be useful when it's brought up in various books or by other players who are trying to define a position in some way. Typical examples of situations that could easily be labeled \"key\" are: __ _. A sharp/tactical position that must be solved or you will be drowned. 188 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION --� A position that you feel should be a win or at least advantageous, but proving that feeling seems far from easy. If your gut tells you there's something nice lurking in the shadows, take the time to find it. --� A quiet position that's in need of a plan or (at least) a series of logical moves that address the imbalances. If you don't know what that plan is, if you can't lecture about the imbalances, then why are you moving? Let's look at examples of each of these scenarios. FIRST -A sharp/tactical position that must be solved or you go under and never come back up: Diagram 192 Smallville (H. Nakamura) - Erebuni, ICC 2009 \\Vhite to move This occurred in a 3-0 blitz game. Here we have an extremely sharp position. White has two Bishops vs. two Knights and possible tactics against black's King. On the other hand, Black is two pawns ahead, is threatening to exchange Queens (which would end white's attack), and is also threatening to rid himself of that attacking f6-pawn by ... Nxf6 or ... Qxf6. White must find something special here or he'll lose. For many players, this would be considered a key position since it's do or die-they have to search long and hard for a miracle since anything less is fatal. For Nakamura it's not a key position because the solution was obvious to him (it held no secrets) and was played in an instant: l.Qxe6!! Black didn't expect this! Now the tables have completely turned and Erebuni finds himself in his own key position (very few players would be able to easily absorb the nuances of this position)-unfortunately, he has no time! And, with his final seconds ticking away, he must find a defense or lose. PART FOUR I PSY CH OLOGICAL MEANDERINGS 189 In the actual game he failed to put up any resistance and quickly got mated after l. . .Ncd6?? (now it's over) 2.Qe7 Nxb7 3.Qf8 mate. Also unpalatable is l. ..Qxf6 2.Qxc4 Qa l+ 3.Kh2 Nd6 4.Qxc5 Nxb7 5.Bxb7 Qd4 6.Qc2 when the two mighty Bishops and the weak dark-squares around black's King leave the second player with an unenviable defensive task. In a game with a long time control, Black would sit and look for that hid­ den way out. It might not be there, but then you would almost certainly lose. So, since you have no choice, tell yourself that there is a defense and spare no effort in unearthing it! As it turns out, Black has one way and one way only to sure salvation: l...Ne5! 2.Qe7 Qdl+ An alternative is 2 ... Qd6, but if ultimately fails: 3.Bd5 Qxe7 4.fxe7 Rxd5 (4 ... Rd7 5.Rxd7 Nxd7 6.Bc6 Ndf6 7.Bf4 is grim for Black-the two Bishops and the monster passed e-pawn will overwhelm him) 5 .Rb8 f6 6.Rxe8+ Kf7 7.Rd8 Nf3 + 8.Kg2 Ne l+ 9.Kfl ReS 10.e8=Q+ Rxe8 ll .Rxe8 Kxe8 12.Kxel and White wins. 3.Bfl 3.Kh2 ?? loses to 3 ... Ng4+. 3 ... Nf3 +! Clearly best. Also possible is 3 ... Qd6, when after 4.Rxa7 c4 5.Qxd6 Nxd6 6.Bf4 black's position is unpleasant but perhaps defensible. 4.Kg2 Nxh4+! The only move since 4 ... Ne l+?? 5.Kh3 is game over. 5.gxh4 Qg4+ and Black draws by perpetual check. SECOND-A position that you feel should be a win or at least advantageous, but proving that feeling seems far from easy. If your gut tells you there's some­ thing nice lurking in the shadows, take the time to find it: Diagram 193 J. Sunye - J. Nunn, Amsterdam 1985 Black to move 190 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N White is a pawn up, but it's clear that b4 will fall. Once that happens White will have the better pawn structure but Black will enjoy a safer King, two Bishops, and (thanks to his lead in development) a bothersome initiative. Because of these facts, Nunn felt that the position should offer him a serious advantage. However, feeling that and proving it are two very different things. For example, Grandmaster Nigel Davies gives the following line: 1 ... BfS 2 .Rb3 Rxb4 3.Rxb4 Rxb4 4.Bxd5 Rb 1+ 5.Kg2 Be4+ 6.Bxe4 Qxe4+ 7.Kh2 \"followed by Qe2 when White survives.\" So we have a key position-Nunn thinks he's much better, but if he wants to prove it his next move is critical. I have no way of knowing how much time Black took for this decision, but you can be sure he didn't take it lightly and refused to move until he was completely happy with the move he deemed best. Of course, all that effort doesn't guarantee success, and sometimes you'll find that your position wasn't as good as you had hoped, while other times you'll simply fail to find the right idea. Nevertheless, building this kind of \"I must find it! \" habit will serve you well in the vast majority of situations. l...c5!? Not your everyday move, so this might have been a bit of a shock to White. Black gets rid of his long-term pawn weakness on c7 and also opens the posi­ tion up for the dark-squared Bishop. All very logical and creative, but this also leaves d5 weak and that plays a big part in white's defensive hopes later in the game. Perhaps it would have been better to retain as much tension as possible by l.. .c6 (making sure d5 won't ever be a problem) 2.BB Bf5 3.Rb2 Rxb4 4.Rxb4 Rxb4 5.Kg2 Rc4! 6.Ne2 Rc2 7.Qd1 Bh6 8.Rfl (8.Re1? ? Bxe3 !) 8 ... Kh7 9.Kh1 Qa3 and White's under a lot of pressure. Whether 1 ... cS is best or whether 1 ... c6 was the move, Nunn's choice sparks the position and forces his opponent to solve difficult problems if he wishes to achieve his best possible result-a draw. Pressure on the opponent and a two­ result game (win or draw) is always a good thing! 2.dxc5 Qxc5 3.Bf3 And not 3.bxc5?? Rxb 1+ 4.Qe 1 Rxe 1+ 5.Kxe 1 Bc3 + 6.Kf1 Rb 1 mate. 3 ... Rxb4 4.Rxb4 Rxb4 5.Qxd5 There goes d5! Now White is a pawn up but his pieces are still hemmed in and his King is insecure. 5 ... Rbl+ 6.Kg2 Qcl 7.Kh2? A mistake. White should have played 7.Qd3 ! when 7 ... Bf5 8.e4 Be6 9.Kh2 Rb3 still leaves Black with some pressure, but one would expect that White has sufficient defensive resources to hold the game. PART FOUR I PS YCHO LOGICAL MEANDERINGS 191 7 ... Qfl 8.Bg2? White is definitely losing after this. Like it or not, White had to give up a piece for two pawns by 8.Bxg4 hxg4 9.Qg2 Qa6 10.Nh3 gxh3 l l.Kxh3 and then hang on for dear life. 8 ...

I_!--!:_I_g_Q-A quiet position that's in need of a plan or (at least) a series oflogical moves that address the imbalances. If you don't know what that plan is, if you can't lecture about the imbalances, then why are you moving? Pam Ruggiero (1982) - Neil (2 190), U.S. 2007 l.c4 Nf6 2.g3 e6 3.Bg2 d5 4.Nf3 c5 5.cxd5 Nxd5 6.Nc3 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Nxd5 Qxd5 9.d4 Qd8 10.dxc5 Bxc5 11 .Bf4 Nc6 12.Qc2 Be7 13 .Rfd1 Qh6 14.a3 f6 Diagram 194 White to move White has an absolutely wonderful position here-she's ahead in develop­ ment, her pieces are active, and black's Queen is vulnerable to attack. There's no winning tactic, so White needs to take a long think and find a plan that takes maximum advantage of the positive imbalances that were just mentioned. For Pam, this is indeed a key position, but a titled player probably wouldn't consider it to be very challenging. In the actual game, Pam played 15 .e4-I tend to label this kind of error as a \"lazy move\" or \"soft move.\" My choice depends on which term will have 192 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION the greatest effect on the particular student-some demand a no-nonsense approach, while others need a gentle hand. In recent chess literature, some authors have referred to these lack-of-effort mistakes as \"half moves\" -a politically correct term (both \"soft move\" and \"half move\" are good choices if you're teaching children) that lets the reader know that the move doesn't do as much as it should. But why is 15.e4 a lazy move? Pam knew she had a great position, but she didn't bother taking enough time to really get into its secrets. Instead she felt that gaining space couldn't be bad and then tossed 15 .e4 onto the board (which, by the way, blocks the g2-Bishop's diagonal). Now, I'm not just pick­ ing on Pam here (who kindly allowed me to use quite a few of her very in­ structive games)! It's important to shout out that \"lazy moves\" are played by everyone at every level! Be that as it may, you can do a lot towards lowering the incidents of lazy moves in your own games by catching yourself during key positions or any time you don't know what to do, and demanding the best effort you can possibly give. Then, if you fail to find a good way to handle the position you can still be proud of yourself-you did your best and nobody can ask more of you than that. Returning to the position in diagram 194, White wants to get as much value for her many positional plusses as possible. Since black's Queen is in the line of fire, White should milk that situation by 15 .Be3 ! when the Queen doesn't have a happy place to move to. Three examples: 15.. .Qc7 16.Nd4! (making immediate use of the pin along the c-file) 16 ... Bd7 17.Qb3 Qb6 (1 7 ... Qc8 18.Racl a5 19.Bh3 and Black is lost) 18.Qxb6 axb6 19.Nf5 is very strong. 15 ... Qa6 16.Ne1! Ne5 (16 ... e5 17.Be4 f5 18.Bd3 b5 19.Qb3 + wins the b5-pawn) 17.Nd3 Nxd3 (1 7 ... Qc4 18.Qcl !-A very accurate move that makes sure the Rooks will protect each other. Also fine is the obvious 18.Racl, though that gives Black 18 ... Qxc2 19 .Rxc2 Rd8 pinning the Knight to the d1 -Rook-18 ... Qxcl 19.Raxcl Nxd3 20.Rxd3 a5 21 .Bc5 Bxc5 22.Rxc5 and White's Rooks will penetrate into black's position) 18.Rxd3 e5 19.Rcl Be6 20.Qc7 and White wins material. 15 ... Qa5 16.Nd4 Nxd4 1 7.Rxd4 e5 (17 ... Rd8 1 8.b4 Qe5 19.Rxd8+ Bxd8 20.Rd1 and white's pieces are raking black's queenside and both files) 18.Qc4+ Kh8 19.Rd5 (embarrassing black's Queen) 19 ... Be6 20.Rxa5 Bxc4 21 .Bxb7 Rab8 22 .Rxa7 Bxe2 2 3 .a4 and the queenside pawns will win the game. PART FOUR I PS YCHOLO GICAL MEANDERINGS 193 Notice how these lines kept Black under severe pressure, tormented his Queen, and also allowed White to make full use of the open c- and d-files. The actual game continued: 15.e4? e5 16.Be3 Qc7 17.Racl Be6 18.h3? Another lazy move, and now white's advantage is more or less gone (1 8.Bfl followed by Bc4, trading the bad Bishop on g2 for the extremely active enemy Bishop on e6, was a much stronger idea). The further course of the battle had many ebbs and flows, with White once again obtaining a winning position only to blunder and actually lose: 18 ... Rfd8 19.Bfl Rxdl 20.Rxdl Rd8 21.Rd2 Rxd2 22.Nxd2 Qc8 23.Kh2 g6 24.Bc4 Kg7 25.Bxe6 Qxe6 26.Qc4 Qxc4 27.Nxc4 b5 28.Nd2 Kf7 29.Kg2 aS 30.Kfl Ke6 31.Ke2 Bd6 32.Kd3 h5 33.Bh6 f5 34.Nf3 Kf6 35.Nel f4 36.Nf3 g5 37.g4 hxg4 38.hxg4 Be7 39.Ngl Ke6 40.Ne2 b4 41.a4 Kd6 42.Kc4 Bd8 43.Bxd8 Nxd8 44.Ncl Nc6 45.Nb3 f3 46.Kb5?

Once we learn how to move the pieces, the next stage of our chess develop­ ment is to get stomped by having our chessmen taken one after the other, falling for mates, and various other horrific demises that teach us that the chessboard is a very unforgiving environment. Naturally, the pain of hanging your Queen or falling for tricks creates the desire to stop the bloodbath and protect your army! And with that initial scarring comes a host of psychological chess disorders which ultimately need to be identified and addressed. Here's a basic example of two players in the 11 00 to 1200 rating range and the travails they go through. It was my student's (Teradeath) second lesson. In our first I pointed out that he reacts far too much to his opponent's innuendos. In this game he tried very hard to recognize and fix that failing. NN - Teradeath (1100), Yahoo Online 2009 l.b3 e5 2.Bb2 Nc6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5 6.h3?! Diagram 202 White is the first to crack! He noticed the possibility of ... Ng4 and became so worried about a horse stampede around his King that he wasted a tempo to prevent it. Instead he should have gone about his business with 6.Nf3 when 6 ... N g4 7.0-0 takes care of the problem while doing something positive that he wanted to do anyway (castling). I should add that White was probably worried about 6.Nf3 Ng4 7.0-0 Nxf2 8.Rxf2 Bxf2+ 9.Kxf2 , but even though point-count will tell us that material is 198 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION even, the fact is that White is the one who would be happy with that exchange. In the middlegame, two minor pieces usually prove stronger than a Rook and pawn since the Rook won't be doing much until a file opens, and since the extra pawn most likely won't make a huge impact on the early stages of the game. Keep in mind that a Rook is nice, but two minor pieces is a gang! 6 ... Bh6 Not a terrible move, but quite unnecessary. Is this really the best Black has? Doesn't he have more important things to do with his move? What move would you play ifWhite had no threat (which he doesn't)? The answer is simple: 6 ... 0-0! Always ask, \"What move would I like to play?\" Then do your best to make it work. 7.Nf3 Now e5 is threatened and that one tiny threat grabs black's attention and makes him do something he probably didn't want to do. 7 ... d4? Of course, if Black had castled then he could defend e5 with the comfortable 7 ... Re8. However, since that's not possible, the simplest and most positive way to guard the pawn was 7 ... Qe7 (or 7 ... Qd6), not fearing 8.Ba3 Bc5 . What's wrong with 7 ... d4? The first thing is psychological: Black felt compelled to do something he didn't particularly wish to do. Other than REMEMBER Before playing a move, always ask, \"What wonderful thing does this do for my position?\" If you can't answer that question, or if the answer has more negatives than positives, one is left wondering how you can justify playing it. 8.c3 l that, the move opens the h 1- a8 diag onal for white's light-squared Bishop, gives white 's Knights access to the c4- square, and blocks black's dark-squared Bishop. Not horrible, but White isn't aware of the perks this move and the subsequent capture on d4 will give his opponent. This will be discussed over the next few moves. 8 ... 0-0 9.cxd4 Nxd4 Quite reasonable, though Black wasn't aware that 9 ... exd4 opened the e-file for his Rook (this would allow him to generate pressure against e2 after ... Re8). Amateurs often have serious trouble getting their Rooks into the game during its early stages. However, once they realize that clearing a pawn off a file gives their Rook(s) a highway to travel on, life becomes much easier. This subject is deeply explored in Part Three, Rooks. PART FOUR I PSYCHOLO GIC AL MEANDERINGS 199 10.Nxd4 Wisely avoiding 1 O.Nxe5? ReS, when White has opened lines to his own King. 10 ...

It's important to get all your pieces into play, and to create long term targets whenever possible! ll .Qc2 c5? Before looking at the game together, my student gave me a copy of it with full annotations. I was proud of him when I saw the note to his 11 th move: \"Is this where I cracked? At the time I was thinking, 'I have to!' as in 'I have to protect my c-pawn in case I need to move my Queen.\"' Looking at it now, I see that 11 ... cS blocks my Bishop in case I want to get it out of the way, and I can't move my b-pawn because it's pinned. I should have considered just 11 ... c6, which protects my c-pawn from white's Queen and my b-pawn from white's g2-Bishop.\" We had discussed \"I can't\" in our first lesson, so his noticing it so quickly was a very positive thing (the first step to slowly but surely ironing the problem out is to recognize it). And, of course, he's right on about 11 ... c6, though White would be okay with 12.Nc3 . 12.0-0 ReS 13 .Nd2 13 .Nc3 was better, when black's dark-squared Bishop is sort of alone on d4. 13 ...

Qg6 200 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Sending the Queen off to the side. This isn't terrible, but it wasn't played for the right reason (his reason was, \"Run for your life!\"). I would have been much happier if he looked that Rook in the eye and played 16 ... Rad8 !, increasing the tension and asking who is facing down whom. After 16 ... Rad8 17.Ne4 (Not best, but it will illustrate why Black didn't have to fear the enemy Rook. 17 .Bxb 7 Bxh3 18.Ne4 was better, though Black has a plus after 18 ... Qxd l) 17 ...

Other good choices were 16 ... Qa6 and 16 ... Qb5, holding onto his material plus, but the psychologically powerful 16 ... Rad8 is a move that would put a huge grin on the face of any teacher. 17.Bxb7 Rad8 Quite good, but a \"soft and/or quick move\" in that Black hadn't really taken stock of what was going on in the position (as demonstrated by his 18th). 17 ... Rab8 18.Bg2 c4 getting rid of the weak c-pawn and creating a weakness on b3 would be reasonable-the idea of ridding yourself of weaknesses while simultaneously giving weak points to your opponent is very important but somewhat advanced. 18.Bg2 Rb8? Black notices the idea of ... c5-c4 and rushes to make use of it. Naturally, he needed to see it a move before by asking (on move 1 7), \"The Rook is going to move, but where would it perform a useful function? I don't want to just move it somewhere, I want to move it where it works with the other pieces and serves a particular purpose.\" As it turns out, 16 ... Qg6 combined with 17 ... Rad8 was okay if seen in the context of building kingside pressure by 18 ... Qh5 ! Then we can see that white's 6.h3 weakened his kingside structure and Black is logically trying to take ad­ vantage of it. Here are some illustrative lines that might occur after 18 ... Qh5. White can try 19.Kh2 or 19.g4: 19.Kh2 e4 (19 ... Ng4+ 20.Kgl Nf6 21 .Kh2 Ng4+ is a draw) 20.Rcl Ng4+ (moves such as 20 ... Bg4! ?, 20 ... Rd5 !?, and 20 ...

All this analysis is very complicated and advanced, but it's worth checking out so you can get a feel how a ruptured kingside pawn structure can easily give the other side counterplay. 19.Nf3 ? It's important to recognize pawn weaknesses and, once you do, to bring your pieces to bear on them. Thus 19.Qa3 (hitting a7 and c5) and 19.Rcl (hitting cS and stopping ... c5-c4) should be natural choices that are fully in line with the imbalances. After 19.Nf3 , Black blundered with 19 ... Bd5?? (allowing 20.Nh4, winning significant amounts of material). Instead, 19 ... e4 would have granted him the kind of kingside counterplay we saw in the note to black's 18th move. I can hear many of you saying, \"I'm much stronger than those guys! I don't make mistakes like that! \" Really? You don't? I beg to differ-everyone under master suffers from the same aberrations as these two players do, though in an increasingly more subtle form as one rises up the rating ladder. The game we just looked at shows how we're buffeted about the board by the winds of fear (soft moves also played a part). We've explored this fear of threats in the previous chapters, Mental Breakdown and Macho Chess, and though we'll continue to see examples of this disease here, it's time to take a serious look at three other psychological disorders: --� Lack of Patience Lazy/Soft Moves Pay Attention! Lack of Patience When you're doing well, it's important to not allow undeserved counterplay. If your advantage is dynamic, then rushing in and clubbing him over and over is often the right thing to do. But if the advantageous imbalances are static (space, superior minor piece, better pawn structure, etc.) then a little patience can go 202 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION a long way towards making your opponent helpless, which in turn lets you reel in the point without unnecessary adventures. At times, the decision is about your playing strength and/or comfort level­ what can you handle, and what is too hot to handle? P. Ruggiero - M.

However, there's a \"tiny\" problem with the f4- and c4-pawns and with big centers in general: the player with the large center has to defend it-ifhe can make it indestructible, then the center rules. If the center proves unsustainable, then it will crumble and the opponent's strategy will win out. With this \"guard the center\" rule in mind, White should look for something that takes care of both vulnerable (c4 and f4) pawns. Since 26.Ngl fails to 26 ... Nb6 (26 ... f6 first might be even better), White is left with three reasonable moves: 26.Ne2 gums up the white army. Black escapes his difficulties with 26 .. .f6 27.e6 Nb6 28.Rcl Nxd5! 29.cxd5 Rxd5 30.Nc3 Nxf4+ 31 .Khl Rd6 32 .Ne4 Rdxe6 33.Nxc5 R6e7, =. 26.Nd2 defends both weak spots at the same time and appears to leave White with a clear advantage. Perhaps that's true, but it's not so easy to prove. Since the center is too strong to leave alone (Black either breaks it down or is broken him­ self), he has to try 26 ... g5 27.fxg5 Rxe5 and we reach a surprisingly complicated position. A quick glance at a couple lines will show us that any ultimate truth is very hard for a mere mortal to discover: 28.Nf3 (2 8.Rxe5 Nxe5 29.Rf5 Re8 PART FOUR I PS YCHOLO GICAL ME ANDERINGS 203 30.d6 Ng7 3l.Rf2 Rd8 33 .Nce4 b6, =, or 30.Kh3 Kg7 3l .NbS Nd3 when Black is still fighting tooth and nail) 28 ...

In deciding which move to play, Pam didn't trust the contortionist 26.Ne2 and, since she missed the threat of ... Nb6 altogether, she didn't see any reason to play 26.Nd2 . Had she noticed that, I suspect 26.Nd2 would have been chosen. It looks good, it looks safe, and it would have taken a very strong player to see that Black actually has ways to rock the boat in that line. As it turns out, she played a third possibility, 26.Ng5, and this appears to be the best move. Nevertheless, she didn't see why it was the best move and, as a result, she would probably have done better with 26.Nd2. 26 ...

Sadly, the world was spinning and clear thought was something to be ex­ perienced in a later game. I've been there many times and I'm sure you have too! 34 ... Nxf4+ 35.Rxf4?? Simply 35 .Khl was quite safe. 35 ... Rxcl 36.Nf6+ Kf7, 0- 1. A complete meltdown. It turns out that 26.Ng5, though the best in the position, wasn't the right move for that particular player at that particular time. The less tactical 26.Nd2 would probably have served her better. I know that claiming someone would do better to avoid the best move sounds insane, but if you aren't able to tame the resulting positions then it's best to play something within your personal range. Another way of putting it is this: the best move isn't the best move if you don't know why it's best. The moral here is: when possible, try to enter lines that you feel you can handle and that suit your personal comfort level, your style, or that particular situation. For example, if I could take a small but solid (and safe!) positional plus vs. grandmaster Shabalov (a man who lives for hyper-complexity) or enter a tactical minefield that might very well offer much more, I would go for the small but solid/safe option unless I was able to convince myself that the com­ plications were definitely good for me, that I had enough time left on the clock to do the position justice, and/or that I could handle it properly without sinking PHILOSOPHY When possible, try to enter lines that you feel you can handle and that suit your personal comfort level, your style, or that particular situation. � under a maze of variations. On the other hand, ifi felt that entering a tactical firestorm was the only cor­ rect way to handle the position, I would happily enter it-you have to do what the board tells you to do! On a higher level, patience (and the avoidance of enemy counterplay) is the major part of the technical repertoire. This kind of refusal to enter anything that's even remotely risky when possessing a technically winning position (as demonstrated in our next example) is known as Cat and Mouse.

Worst of all, Black has nothing to attack and no counterplay of any sort-he just has to sit there and wait for the axe to fall. In such situations, many experienced players begin a game of Cat and Mouse. They go out of their way to avoid any counterplay, and they refuse to activate any enemy piece. Instead they slowly improve their pawns and pieces until everything is optimally placed. And then (and only then!) they take aim at some juicy target(s) and enjoy a \"snack\" (winning a pawn in this fashion adds to the overall advantage and lets the enemy know that he's not only lost in the middlegame, but also in most endgames)-however, the snack won't be eaten if doing so would allow the opponent sudden activity. This kind of total domination doesn't occur too often, and when it does some players prefer to seek ways to end things a bit faster. But the Cat and Mouse idea makes good sense since it allows the stronger side to keep his opponent completely under his thumb, to avoid any and all tricks, and to pretty much guarantee victory at some point down the road. Also keep in mind that the defending side will be thoroughly miserable throughout this process, and will sometimes just resign so he doesn't have to continue looking at the sickening sight that's in front of him. 206 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION 38.Rd5 White prepares to improve the position of this Rook. To be quite honest, 38.Rxd6! was stronger, but why trade a Rook for that dead enemy Bishop, and why take any chances whatsoever when you're having such a good time torturing the opponent in slow, delicious fashion? After 3 8.Rxd6 Bxd6 3 9 .Rxd6 Black would find himself facing some serious threats. Here's an example of what might occur: 39 ... f6 40.Rxf6 is awful. 39 ...

Black was probably relieved to end this nightmare. When I was thirteen and deeply addicted to chess, I hung out with two other chess kids-both were considerably better than me. The oldest and strongest, Peter Wise, kindly looked over my games and gave me advice. One incident always stuck in my mind: I was White and had tossed out about 10 moves of some opening when I played h2-h3 . Peter then posed one of the hardest questions anyone had ever asked me-\"Why did you play that move?\" I was stumped! Thinking about it, I finally said, \"It was my move and I had to do something.\" Of course, this sounds incredibly basic, but over the years I've posed this exact question hundreds of times to students during lessons and chess fans that attended my lectures who ranged in rating from 1000 to 2300. And, I often got a similar reply to the one I gave so many decades ago: \"I didn't know what to do.\" \"It looked good so I played it.\" \"I was low on time so I played this fast to gain time on the clock.\" \"It threatened his Queen so it had to be good.\" I say these are similar because in each case the person responding didn't really know what was going on in the position and just did \"something,\" hoping to figure out the truth later in the game. PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGIC AL MEANDERINGS 209 The fact is, when you're playing a game you should generally be able to lec­ ture on your position at any given time. You might not be right about all the details-in fact, you might be completely off base. But at least, in your mind, you would have a handle on the goings on and, as a result, be able to make moves that conform to that knowledge and certainty. Even a 1200 player can say, \"Well, I have an advantage in space so I pushed this pawn in an effort to get more.\" The pawn push might be good or it might be bad, but at least it would conform to his version of the board's reality. Naturally, my whole idea of imbalances is designed to give you something to grasp onto. Whether you fully grasp imbalances or have only a faint inkling, recognizing them will give you the guidance everyone needs to make an informed decision (or at least feel confident when playing a move that's completely bon­ kers-even misguided confidence counts for a lot!). The point of this section, though, isn't about imbalances per se-it's about a player failing to make use of knowledge he already possesses when ponder­ ing a move, or a player being too lazy to even bother making the effort to find something worthwhile. Once again, the cure for this \"it was my move and I had to do something\" nightmare starts with an awareness of the problem that the particular position is posing to you. And, when I teach, I go to the next step by telling my students, \"Before you make any move, be aware that I'm going to ask you to describe every detail of this position after the game's over, and I'll want you to tell me how the move you played catered to those details.\" Keep in mind that it doesn't matter if the student gets things right or wrong. What does matter is the effort he makes-it's that effort that trains his mind and ultimately helps him acquire the good chess habits that will serve him for the rest of his life. Let's take a look at three examples, moving up the rating ladder in each game. Teradeath (1100) - Khilane08 (1100), Yahoo Online 2009 l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Qf6 Diagram 208 210 HO W TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Teradeath wasn't expecting 2 ... Qf6. Here he needed to ask, \"This seems strange. You're not supposed to move your Queen right away because it can be vulnerable to attacks by the other pieces, so how I can take advantage of2 ... Qf6?\" That's all it took; he didn't need a deeper understanding of the position than that to come up with a promising move. In the game White gave up on try­ ing to capitalize on his opponent's move and played passively with 3 .d3, which frees the cl -Bishop but blocks the other Bishop on fl ! Does White really have to punish his light-squared Bishop if he wants to spank ... Qf6? Anyway, Black was so freaked out by the \"threat\" of Bg5 (a classic \"I can't allow it! \" moment) that he replied with 3 ... h6 (ignoring the threat by 3 ... Nc6 4.Bg5 Qg6 was fully playable) and White suddenly got with the program and continued 4.Nc3 c6 5 .d4 with the superior position. Instead of moving the d-pawn twice, the most obvious move is also the best: 3.Nc3 Nc6 Now 3 ... c6 4.d4! (This once again makes Bg5 \"on\" and also initiates quick central play in order to try and punish black's premature Queen move.) 4 ... exd4 5 .Bg5 Qg6 6.Qxd4 leaves White with more central space and a signifi­ cant advantage in development. 4.Nd5 Hard to resist-White brings his Knight to a nice square and attacks the enemy Queen at the same time. Of course, the quiet 4.Bc4, bringing the Bishop to a very active diagonal, also makes good sense. 4 ... Qd6 I'm only giving this poor move to show how simple but logical moves like 3.Nc3 can often put so much pressure on an opponent that he can easily make a serious mistake. Instead of 4 ... Qd6, 4 ... Qd8 was far safer, though White can be happy with the result of the opening after 5 .Bc4 or 5 .d4. 5.c4! A move that is purely opportunistic. White wants to overwhelm Black by making use of the tender nature of c7. That requires energy (quiet positional play is no longer called for), so White will do everything in his power to force black's Queen to move away and lose touch with its defense of c7. Some lines (see diagram 209): 5 ...

Is it wise to open up the position before you castle? 212 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION That alone should excite White and make him dream of ways to completely rip open the center so he can reach the enemy King. In the game, White played 9.a3 when 9 ... f4 gives Black serious attacking chances. Clearly, 9.a3 didn't even try to punish Black-it was a lazy move that simply recreated patterns White was familiar with (gaining queenside space with a3 followed by b4). He was playing on autopilot and not even addressing his opponent's moves. If he had stopped and taken stock of the imbalances of this situation (White has a hole on d4 while Black has a kingside space advantage; White's only plus is that centrally placed enemy King), he might have realized that a static plan wasn't the answer and that a dynamic solution was called for (we'll explore the static/dynamic concept in great detail in Part Six, Statics vs. Dynamics). This kind of reasoning takes us to: 9.exf5 ! Taking the position in hand and opening up new lines. 9 ... gxf5 9 ... Bxf5 loses material to 1 O.g4 when Black gets some, but not enough, com- pensation after 10 ... Bd3 1l .gxh5 Qh4 12 .Na4.

Clearly, the ro­ botic 9.a3 , though a common idea in the English Opening, wasn't right for this particular position. As should be evident, a fresh look can pay huge dividends. Although these last two examples showed how lazy thinking led to missed dynamic and/or tactical possibilities, the same can be said about positional ideas. In the following game we witness a high-class example of a very astute chess outlook. J. Rowson - L. Cooper, Walsall l997 l.c4 b6 2.d4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb7 4.a3 fS S.dS Nf6 6.g3 g6 7.Nf3 exdS S.cxdS Bg7 Diagram 21 2 This position features a central space advantage for White, a battle for the important e4-square (Black would like to airlift his b8-Knight there-he usually accomplishes this by ... Na6-c5-e4), some early black pressure along the al -h8 diagonal, a strong d5 -pawn that needs tending else you might drop it, and the fact that White will be better if he can finish development and place his Rooks on cl and dl. Note that ... d6 for Black is problematic since that would weaken the c6- and e6-squares (White would eye them with Bg2 followed by Nd4). There's a lot of tension in this seemingly simple position, and the going can get tricky. Most players would toss out 9.Bg2 without thinking, but Rowson didn't fall victim to that kind of soft thinking. Instead he realized that he might be able to make serious gains if he could deprive the b8-Knight access to c5 by making b4 a possibility. Since the immediate 9.b4 fails to 9 ... Ne4, he came up with: 9.Rbl ! Extremely nice! Now that the Rook is off the al-h8 diagonal, b2-b4 is sud­ denly a viable idea. To be honest, I'm not convinced this is actually stronger than 9.Bg2 Na6 10.Bf4, but that doesn't matter-the fact that he kept his hand 214 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION away from the fl -Bishop and actually thought, \"Maybe there's something better. Maybe I can isolate that Knight and deprive him of his usual play.\" is far more impressive than most combinations. 9 ... 0-0 Black meets an extraordinary idea with a generic reply. Small wonder that he soon finds himself in trouble. Instead, he needed to either fight for the right to employ the usual plan (that b8-Knight must find a way to make an imprint on the central battle!), or try and take advantage of the loss of time that 9.Rb1 entailed. Let's give a quick look at both: 9 ...

Hopefully this game and illustrative analysis (a true analysis would easily fill several pages) gives you a taste of the psychology and willpower needed in up­ per level chess: one player comes up with an idea that might allow him to take over the position, and if the other doesn't match him with a bright concept of his own, his game will quickly go downhill.

Lazy moves often emerge when the hard work in a game is done and you mistakenly think that the rest will play itself. Our next game is a drastic (and painful!) example. J. Silman - Z.

Bxe6 Diagram 214 White to move and end his opponent Here, after finding all the hard moves and achieving a position that Black could resign with a clear conscience, I relaxed and began thinking about the brilliance of my combination. And, while I was busy patting myself on the back, I stopped playing chess. 24.BbS+? Amazing. I glanced at this move, saw that it won the Exchange, and just played it without looking for anything better. 24.Qxd4+! Ke7 (24 ...

Ke7 25.Qf6+ Kf8 26.Qxh8+ Ng8 Obviously, 24.Bb5+ was winning, but it made things harder than they needed to be. Once you take the \"lazy train to nowhere,\" you often find it's shockingly easy to stay on that train until all your good earlier work is undone. 27.Bd3 ? 27.Rce 1 with the threat of Rxe6 was crushing. Other easy winners were 27.Qxh5 and 27.Bc4. 27 ... Qg5 28.Qxd4 Rd8 Suddenly Black has a bit of activity. His game is still lost, but now White had to put some work into it, which I was clearly not prepared to do. 29.Qh4+ Ne7 30.Bc4 30.Rce 1 increases the heat and is still pretty easy. 30 ... Rd2 31 .Qxb7 Nd5 At this point I was extremely upset. I knew I had botched things (though White's still winning) and couldn't get back on track. 32.Qh8+ Kg7 33.Qg3?? 3 3 .Rg 1 was still winning, but I couldn't bring myself to play such a defensive move. Wasn't I mating him a few moves ago? Here's what Angus Dunnington (in his book, Chess Psychology) had to say about this kind of situation: \"When a hitherto sweet-smelling game suddenly turns sour we tend to dwell on where we might have gone wrong, or we simply look down on the area of the board where the opponent has just turned the tables and see only these enemy pieces that have done-or are about to do-the damage.\" 33 ... Qxg3 34.hxg3 Ne3 35.Bxe6 Nxfl 36.Rxfl fxe6 37.Rf4 Rxb2 38.Rxa4 and the game was eventually drawn. Years later, because of agonizing failures like the one we just saw, I changed my whole mindset. When reaching a position as in diagram 214, I began to take a long time to soak up every juicy bit of goodness it offered. Why rush when I could lick my lips, take a glance at my opponent's red, defeated face, and simply enjoy the moment? Then I would jump back into the position and give myself a small challenge: \"How can I execute him in the most effective manner? What's the very best way to mop things up?\" Of course, I still had my share of soft move failures, but my newfound con­ certed effort to retain focus enabled me to avoid a lot of disasters that my earlier attitude would have created. PART FOUR I PS YC HOLO GICAL MEANDERING$ 217 Pay Attention! In my teens and early twenties, one of my biggest failings as a player was the \"quick move\" (making moves too fast). When it was my turn I'd often just bash a piece on some square (usually planned a few moves before) and expect it to make my opponent swoon. Invariably, the move was either \"soft\" (not re­ ally giving the position what it needed) or a downright blunder. Yet, I wasn't aware of this habit until Dennis Waterman, a very strong master, told me that he'd watched my games for quite a while and noticed that most of my losses were due to this \"illness.\" That one bit of insight made a big difference in my subsequent results, though I continued to suffer the occasional relapse right up to the end of my career. Here's one of the games Waterman was alluding to. J. Silman - J. McCormick, Berkeley 197 4 l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bg5 e6 7.Qd2 a6 8.0-0-0 Bd7 9.f4 h6 10.Bh4 ReS ll.Nf3 Qa5 12.Bc4 b5 13.Bb3 b4 14.Bxf6 gxf6 15.Ne2 Qb6 16.f5 Na5 17.Nf4 Nxh3 + 18.axb3 h5 19.Kbl aS 20.e5 fxe5 21 .Nxe5 Bb5 22.Nxf7 Kxf7 23.fxe6+ Ke8 24.Nd5 Qc5 25.Qg5 Qxc2+ Diagram 215 White to move Here I only had two legal moves, and both seemed more than adequate. So I quickly tossed one out and waited for my opponent to resign. 26.Ka2?? I thought either King move was 1-0 and I didn't take any time to verify this opmwn. 26 ... a4 and suddenly I realized that I'd botched another game since now the b3-pawn is hanging with check. A draw was agreed after 26 ... a4 (2 7.Nf6+ Kd8 218 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION 28.Nd5+). Of course, 26.Kal (threatening 27.Rcl) would have won on the spot since 26 ... a4 followed by 27 ... axb3 would no longer be with check. Here's one more example of a quick move. Hopefully it will prove scary enough to make you seriously think about sitting on your hands and only moving when you are 100% sure about what's going on and what you want to accomplish. And, of course, make sure the move you intend to play is actually the one your hand is trying to make! J. Fedorowicz - J. Silman, American Open 1989 l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Bxf6 gxf6 9.Na3 b5 10.Nd5 Bg7 ll .c3 Ne7 12.Nc2 Nxd5 13 .Qxd5 Rb8 14.Ne3 Bh6 15.Qd3 Bxe3 16.Qxe3 Qb6 17.Qf3 Ke7 18.Bd3 Rg8 19.h3 Be6 20.0-0 Rg6 21 .Kh2 Rbg8 22.Rgl Qc6 23 .Qe3 f5 24.g3 Rf6 25.exf5 Bxf5 26.Radl Bxd3 27.Rxd3 Qc5 28.Qxc5 dxc5 29.Kg2 Diagram 21 6 Black to move I hadn't experienced any serious problems in this game and now intended to play 29 ... Rd6 when a draw would have followed since 30.Rxd6 (3 0.Rgd l Rxd3 31 .Rxd3 Ke6) 30 ... Kxd6 31 .Kf3 h5 is completely equal. However, someone had entered the tournament hall that I wanted to speak to. So, after White played the expected 29.Kg2 , I didn't write down his move or even give the position any thought. I just reached out for the f6-Rook, and in true blitz fashion (though I had lots of time left) moved \"it\" to the d-file. 29 ... Rd8?? And, as I let this Rook go, it suddenly struck me that I had grabbed the wrong Rook! Fedorowicz gave me a strange look and chopped on d8. 30.Rxd8 Kxd8 31 .Rdl+ And, as hysteria, confusion, and self-loathing blasted my mind to bits, the Fed stuck his face in mine and said, \"You gotta pay attention!\" PART FOUR I PSY CHOLOGICAL MEANDERING$ 219 Small wonder that I didn't put up any resistance at all and went down quickly: 3l. ..

For all you blunder prone players out there that move too quickly, memorize/ take to heart/obey Grandmaster Fedorowicz's dictate: You gotta pay attention! Naturally, the \"pay attention\" adage doesn't just protect a player from a wan­ dering hand or an obvious blunder. It also helps you see tricks that might have easily gone unnoticed. Diagram 217 I. A. Horowitz - M. Pavey, New York 1951 Black to move Black is an Exchange and two pawns ahead and can win as he pleases. In fact, I can imagine Mr. Pavey feeling rather insulted that White was playing on. Rybka likes 1 ... Kb6 and 1 ... Kd6, ending all sane checks and forcing White to self-destruct with 2.Bg2 Qg4+ (forcing the exchange of Queens, which really is game over), or 2.Kg2 Qxg5+ 3.Kh3 Qxh6+, which is downright humiliating. However, a human tends to like more forcing continuations, so Pavey found something that was both cute and, apparently, devastating. l.. .Qxf3+?? Pavey must have expected a handshake at this point. Surely Horowitz would resign now! 2.Qxf3 Ra3 I'm sure Pavey still expected resignation. 3.Kh4! As I write this, I'm feeling Pavey's pain. Two moves earlier, with so many pieces and pawns on the board, Pavey never imagined that a stalemate would be possible! 3 ... Rxf3, 1h-1h.

FOUR - TBST 26 Diagram 22 1 [Level: 1400 - 1800] Black to move Summary Weak Squares In chess, it's easy to get a bit overwhelmed by all the ABCs that are tossed at the poor student. In particular, memorization-based material is often extremely daunting but also shockingly unrewarding. The most prized lessons in chess are those that train the mind to see things in a completely new way while also plant­ ing the seeds for proper mental habits. Here we'll look at Target Consciousness, one of the game's most overlooked yet critically important concepts. I try very hard to instill a deep understanding and appreciation of Target Consciousness in all my students (it doesn't matter if they are rated 1200 or 2200). This term helps ram home a form of mental training where the player, in an almost shark­ like manner, learns to instantly recognize all potential targets and, once he finds one, to leap on it like a shark rushes to blood. I created the term when I found students ignoring glaring targets. \"Why not make use of that weak square? \" I'd ask. The answer didn't please me. \"Square? You're kidding, right? Why bother with a square? It's not like I can capture it and put in the box.\" \"Okay, why not go after that isolated pawn?\" I kept trying! \"I suppose I could, but his King is over there!\" I gave it one last go. \"Yes, I know where his King is, but it's guarded by his whole army while you don't have more than a couple pieces in that area. His pawn, though, is hanging out to dry. \" However, it seemed hopeless. \"Yes, I see that the pawn is weak, but his King is over there!\" Sigh. As a result of this kind of conversation (repeated with many, many students), I realized that it was my job to make them realize that you can only attack a King if there's reason to do so (wanting to attack it isn't a reason!). Thus, I showed an endless cascade of games where grandmasters would dominate a square and/ or surround and eventually pick off a pawn and score an easy victory. Once a player is fully convinced that there's a safer, more reliable way to win at chess than unsound King-hunts, the idea of Target Consciousness becomes a passion! And, with that huge shift in general chess consciousness, the player is on his way to becoming a serious threat to anyone. Of course, at times there won't be any existing targets. In that case you might decide to develop your forces, play for a superior minor piece or more space, 226 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION nuke the board with a positional sacrifice of some sort, unleash a crazed tactic, try to behead his King (yes, there are many occasions when you should go after the enemy King!), or do any number of useful things. But a player that's a Target Consciousness junkie won't only be looking for targets to attack, he'll also be looking for ways to create them! Once he does that, he'll immediately sink his teeth into his new creation and chew the night away. We'll address three types of targets in this section: WEAK PAWNS-Perhaps the most common target. If an enemy pawn can't be defended by another pawn, then your Target Consciousness mindset should make you want to gang up on the thing. �EA�_�QU�B._�S-A complex of weak squares allows a Rook to smoothly slide down a file (see Part Three: Rooks) and a Bishop to do its long-range \"dominate the diagonal\" dance (see Part Two: Minor Pieces). A single weak square, situated on the 4th, 5th, or 6th ranks, allows a Knight (or another piece) to set up shop close to or deep inside the enemy's camp. These things allow your pieces to become stronger than their enemy counterparts. THE KING-If the enemy King is stuck in the center, it might be time to put on your executioner's cap and go for it! Ready to reprogram your brain so that it becomes a lean, mean, Target Con­ sciousness machine? If so, turn the page and let's get this difficult but extremely rewarding process underway! Weak pawns appear, in one form or another, far more often than you might suppose. At times the weak pawn offers dynamic compensation-that idea will be explored in Part Six, Statics vs. Dynamics. However, here we'll concentrate on the negative aspect of this kind of pawn and try and instill in the reader an overwhelming desire to go after them like a starving hyena goes after meat. The Isolated Pawn An isolated pawn on an open file (of course, an isolated pawn that doesn't stand on an open file usually isn't as big a problem since then the enemy Rooks can't bother it) is subject to attack by just about everything-the attacker's Queen, Rooks, Bishops and Knights can all join in the party. However, the defender's army, if allowed to get active, often gives the pawn's owner quite a bit of com­ pensation. Thus, a general rule is that the side playing against the isolated pawn should strive to exchange as many minor pieces as possible. This limits counterplay and more or less turns the pawn into a pure weakness. Diagram 222 Black to move Black has an isolated d-pawn but White has created his ideal setup: No minor pieces-In many situations an isolated pawn can claim active minor pieces as compensation. However, if all the minor pieces are exchanged then that kind of compensation would be impossible and the pawn would be relegated to a pure weakness. 228 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION __ ..._ A Queen and Rook (even better than a Queen and two Rooks, which gives the defender a bit more potential for counterplay) is best since the presence of Queens makes it far too dangerous for the defender's King to come forward and join in the defense of the pawn. --� The Rook blocks the pawn (stopping it from advancing), the Queen is behind it, and this doubling puts maximum pressure against the weakness. These factors leave Black completely passive, and all he can do is try and hold on. He might draw on occasion (many pawn down Rook endgames occur that can be drawn with perfect play), but it's a miserable defensive chore and most players will crack. In our present position White threatens to win d5 by making use of the pin along the d-file with c3 -c4. 1. .. b5 For the time being, this prevents the advance of white's c-pawn. White can now make use of two ideas (the particulars of a given position will decide which is superior): he can play to create a new weakness by a2-a4, or he can just go for it by b3 followed by c4. 2.h3 Also possible is 2.a4 bxa4 (2 ... Qc6 3.axb5 axb5 and now the b3 followed by c4 idea is still very much on the table, while he can also \"massage\" Black and just torment his weak points by 4.Qd3 which gives attention to both b5 and d5) 3.Rxa4 Rd6 4.Rd4 and White goes right back to his c3 -c4 idea. 2 ...

RULE Trade minor pieces when your opponent has an isolated pawn. Diagram 223 \\Vhite to move PART FIVE I TA RGET CONSCIOUSNESS 229 Of course, the side with the isolated pawn usually strives to retain his minor pieces so he can counterbalance the pawn weakness with dynamic piece play. However, when the minor pieces do get traded, the defender can still avoid a long night of pain by exchanging all the Rooks. l.Rael The threat of 2.Re7 is serious business, and Black has to address it in some way or risk getting into a bit of trouble. l. ..

ReS. 2.Rxe8+ Rxe8 3.Rxe8+ Qxe8 and Black has nothing since the Queen and Rook vs. Queen and Rook pin against the d-pawn (as seen in the previous example) no longer exists, while one lone Queen can't pressure the d-pawn enough to inconvenience the defender. Now that the reader has a basic but highly useful knowledge of how to play against the isolated d-pawn (and how to try and hold on if the isolated pawn goes bad-namely, retain minor pieces and/or exchange all the Rooks), let's see if grandmasters actually make use of these ideas too. A. Fishbein - Y. Shulman, U.S. Chmp 2006 RULE If you have an isolated pawn and you've failed to generate dynamic compensation for it, it's often a good defensive idea to exchange all the Rooks, which prevents the opponent from placing maximum pressure against your weakness. l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 c5 4.exd5 exd5 5.Ngf3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.0-0 Ne7 9.Nb3 Bd6 10.c3 Bg4 ll .Be2 0-0 12.Be3 ReS 13.h3 Bh5 14.Rel Bg6 15.Bd3 Qc7 Diagram 224 230 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION This kind of position is often seen in the Tarrasch French.

I'll share a tale here. This game was being followed live on a demonstra­ tion board (along with four others) in the event's analysis room. Two famous international masters were commenting on it to a large audience and agreed that it should be \"drawn at any moment.\" I was watching from the front row and thought that Black was in for a rough ride-he might draw, but it wouldn't be fun at all ! However, I didn't say anything since I felt it would be rude to contradict the speakers, who were exhausted after a long, hard day's work and who had their hands full trying to make sense of this and the other four games as well! I also think they were influenced by the strength of the player with the Black pieces-they were sure he wouldn't allow himself to get into the kind of trouble we discussed in diagram 222. But no player is infallible, and even grandmasters can (and often do) fall victim to the formulas and setups (no matter how basic you deem them to be) being taught in this book! 32 ... Nc6 33.Rdl Ne5 Of course Black avoids 33 ... Nxd4 34.Rxd4 Qc6 35.Qdl when we're back to our main \"theme\" position. The threat of c3 -c4 makes life difficult for the second player: 35 ...

The Backward Pawn The backward pawn shares many of the same shortcomings as the isolated pawn, and several of the anti-isolated pawn ideas also apply to this weak little critter. Of course, the superior side needs to make sure the backward pawn remains backward, but once this is done then we see old friends like \"trade the minor pieces\" and \"pile up with the Rooks and Queen\" rear their effective heads. 236 HO W TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION L.

Diagram 230 Black to move White's backward d4-pawn gains space but, due to the reduced material and absence of the Knights and light-square Bishops (which will soon come off the board), Black enjoys more than enough room to maneuver. Since White has no target to attack, while Black can pound away on d4 with his Rooks, Queen, and dark-squared Bishop, it's clear that black's completely in charge. 20 ... Rd5 White threatened to rid himself of the backward pawn by 21.d5 so Black freezes it in place. That's a good, thematic thing to do, but I would have preferred the less flashy 20 ... Bxe4 21 .Qxe4 Rd5 with play similar to the actual game. The reason for this will be seen in our next note. 21.b4 White should have given 21 .Bxf5 a go since 21 ... exf5 gives white counterplay down the open e-file, and 21.. .Rxf5?? 22 .d5 Qg6 23 .d6 has allowed the weak pawn to turn into a monster passed pawn. Also note that the Bishop, which was such a poor, purely defensive piece, suddenly (after 21.. .Rxf5?? 22 .d5) enjoys a new lease on life with the opening of the a1-h8 diagonal. After 21 .Bxf5 Black would have to play 21 ... Qxf5 but that allows the exchange of Queens, which in turn lets White safely use his King to give extra support to PART FIVE I TA RGET CONSCIOUSNESS 237 d4: 21.. .Qxf5 22.Qxf5 Rxf5 23 .g3 Rd8 24.Kg2 Rd7 25 .Rf2 Rfd5 26.Rd2 Bd8 27.Re5 Bf6 28.Rxd5 Rxd5 29.Kf3 when White is okay. 21...g6 Both White and Black seem to have decided that Bxf5 isn't anything to worry about (though I feel it's white's best chance), so I won't bring the possibility up again.

White can, of course, chop on g5 (3 5 .fxg5 hxg5) but then the typical isolated pawn \"make use of the pin\" idea is on the table-White would always have to make sure that ... e6-e5 doesn't do him in. 35.Qe4?

Diagram 232 Z. Andriasian - M. Erdogdu, Kalamaria 2008 White to move White has a long list of favorable imbalances: He has more central and king­ side space, his Knight is better than either enemy Bishop, black's f6-pawn is in need of constant defense, his backward pawn on d6 is under the gun from white's doubled Rooks, and last but certainly not least, he has an extra pawn (though the h5-pawn is a doubled h-pawn, Black must always be on his guard to prevent h5-h6 in a position where the Rooks are exchanged since then it will run for a touchdown). However, as good as all that is, Black's still (barely) managing to hold things together. And this brings us back to a point I made in our last example, which alluded to the creation of a second weakness: In general, a player can hold when only one point is being attacked. But if you add another weakness to his position then the added defensive burden proves to be too much. This concept is often called The Principle ofTwo Weaknesses. PART FIVE I TA RGET CONSCIOUSNESS 239 Clearly, I'm spurring White on to find a way to create one or more new tar­ gets in black's camp, which when added to all the rest of white's riches, should prove decisive. l.a4!

Doubled Pawns Most players have a mortal fear of acquiring doubled pawns. However, we'll see in Part Six, Statics vs. Dynamics that they also have their good points (i.e., added control of important squares and space gaining powers). Here we'll concentrate on doubled pawns that are indeed weak-targets to be surrounded and chewed on. In general, doubled isolated pawns on an open file are every bit as weak as you might imagine them to be (Okay, there are quite a few exceptions where the doubled isolated lepers shine-those will also be explored in Part Six, Statics vs. Dynamics): 240 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 233 TheTurkey (1 582) - computer, Internet 2008 Black to move For a short time I taught a young man that only played computers online. He told me that his handle was an abomination of The Turk, a chess-playing automaton that wowed the world when it appeared in 1790. In one lesson I extolled the virtues of the Maroczy Bind formation and he fell in love with it. Unfortunately his bind turned into a bust and he found himself with a horrible pawn structure and passive pieces. In such positions the superior side usually attacks the more advanced pawn simply because his pieces can reach it. Thus c4 is the target, while c3 is also being eyed by the g7-Bishop. l. .. Ba6 Since c4 is the target, Black begins to pile on the pressure by bringing as many pieces as possible to bear on it. 2.f4 This just creates new problems (e4 is weakened), but White was in serious trouble in any case and one can understand his desire to be active. 2 ... Na5 Simply threatening to snap the c4-pawn off. 3.Rb4 Bh6 Not a \"human\" looking move, but white's opponent is not human! This power­ ful move pins the f4-pawn, ties the e3-Bishop down to its defense, and prepares to create new targets in white's camp if allowed. 4.g3 e5! If you noticed that this creates a backward pawn on d6 and a huge hole on d5, then you deserve a lot of credit-you're training yourself to instantly spot weaknesses over the whole board! However, White's in such a defensive crouch that he's in no position to reach those potential targets. Aside from increasing PART FIVE I TA RGET CONSCIOUSNESS 241 the pressure against f4, the main purpose of the move is to open the e-file and begin a new attack against e4! 5.Rfl Rfe8 Not subtle, but strong-it was only now that White realized that he faced some serious nastiness on the e-file. 6.Bd3 In a way this is almost funny-the poor light-squared Bishop is bravely trying to hold up white's whole position by getting off the dangerous e-file, protecting e4, and also protecting c4. Sadly, it's all for naught. 6 ... exf4 7.Bxf4 White didn't like the look of 7.gxf4, and it turns out that his position would resemble a bug splattered on the windshield of a fast moving car after 7 ... d5 !!

His pieces aren't doing anything, his King is still in the center, his e-pawn is backward on an open file (and it kills its own light-squared Bishop), the c4-pawn is being eyed by the fine Knight on e5, and the pawns on a3 and c3 are both loose. A player schooled in the ways of Target Consciousness would be drooling at this point. 18 ... Qa5 Simple. The pawns on a3 and c3 are both threatened and material must be lost. Please remember that I realize 18 ... Qa5 is an obvious move. The move isn't the point here. What I'm after is you training your mind to quickly take note of all possible targets in any and every situation. 19.Rc2 Qxa3 20.0-0 Qa4 Having fed, Black decides to bring his Queen back to base camp before it gets trapped behind enemy lines. This is a very human and reasonable way to play, but a serious look might have convinced Black that his Queen wasn't in danger, which means he could seek more aggressive and productive ideas. This makes good sense here since white's pieces are still rather ineptly placed, black's Queen is still serving a function on a3 by tying white's guys down to the defense of c3, and it never hurts to have a material plus and the initiative to boot!

What's even worse is that, while White has nothing on the kingside or in the center (d6 is easily defended, though white's pieces are too inflexible to even make a play for it), Black will take control of the queenside by advancing his a- and b-pawns. This means that Black is both statically and dynamically better. 16 ... b5 17.Qg3 aS 18.Rd2 a4 19.Bdl a3 Nothing wrong with 19 ...

I'm not sure why, though perhaps they are trying to give their Irish \"buddies\" a jab for fun. For all I know, the Irish call the same center the English Pawn Center. Either way, it's more colorful than Tripled Pawns. Having trips is rarely a positive thing. However, as is usual with all weak pawns, squares are controlled and dynamic compensation can, on occasion, be found. Here we'll address not the \"pile up on the poor trips and win them\" ideal (it's the same idea that we've seen with other kinds of weak pawns), but an­ other, more subtle, advantage that the Irish Pawn Center bestows on the opponent. Diagram 237 N. Short - I. Sokolov, Wijk aan Zee 2005 White to move --- ----- ---------------------------- PART FI VE I TA RGET CONSCIOUSNESS 245 Black's a pawn up but e6 is about to fall, which will create material equality. But is the material (after White takes on e6) really equal? It should be obvious that one can attack trips in various ways and demonstrate their vulnerability. But another problem with trips (and it's a big one!) is that a single enemy pawn can freeze the whole Irish Center! In diagram 2 3 7 we see white's two queenside pawns firmly holding black's three in place. Even if the b3 -pawn is captured (as eventually occurred in the actual game), the lone c4-pawn keeps the Irish Center in thrall. l.fxe6 Rdl 2.Rf7 Rd6 3.Rxg7 Rdxe6 4.Rxe6 Rxe6 5.Rf7 So far the play has been pretty straightforward. White intends to get his King into the action so it can help run his g-pawn to g8. Black's pawns (all three of them) don't have any impact at all on the subsequent play. Note that 5 .Rf7 does two things: 1) It stops Black from winning the b3 -pawn since 5 ... Re3 can now be met by 6.Rf3 ; 2) It will turn the f-file into an impass­ able barrier for black's King.

In many situations an isolated pawn can claim active minor pieces as compensation. However, if all the minor pieces are exchanged then that kind of compensation would be impossible and the pawn would be relegated to a pure weakness. 0 Play for a Queen and Rook vs. Queen and Rook situation (even better than a Queen and two Rooks, which gives the defender a bit more potential for counterplay) since the presence of Queens makes it far too dangerous for the defender's King to come forward and join in the defense of the pawn. 0 A dream setup (with Q and R vs. Q and R): The Rook blocks the isolated d-pawn (stopping it from advancing), and the Queen is behind it. '',%!, ,': '>i'::z> Our anti-isolated d-pawn rules also apply to other types of isolated pawns. ,, ,, : i>>� The backward pawn shares many of the same shortcomings as the isolated pawn, and several of the anti-isolated pawn ideas also apply to this weak little critter. Of course, the superior side needs to make sure the backward pawn remains backward, but once this is done then we see old friends like \"trade the minor pieces\" and \"pile up with the Rooks and Queen\" rear their effective heads. � In general, doubled isolated pawns on an open file are usually every bit as weak as you might imagine them to be. � It should be obvious that one can attack tripled pawns in various ways and demonstrate their vulnerability. But another problem with trips (and it's a big one!) is that a single enemy pawn can freeze all three enemy pawns! o,: , '' > If you have the luxury of endless time, then creating optimal King safety is always a good idea. , ro,n > In general, a player can hold when only one weakness is being attacked. But if you add another weakness to his position, -- ---------- ----------- PART FIVE I TARGET CONSCIOUSNESS 247 then the added defensive burden proves to be too much. This concept is often called The Principle of Two Weaknesses. ::::::::::::::> The more weaknesses you give your opponent, the merrier the party will be. The idea of a weak square is, for some, an extremely hard concept to fully grasp. While hunting down a weak pawn makes sense in that you can capture it and remove it from the board, a square always remains where it started-it can't be taken, it can't be placed in a box, and it's not something that initially belongs to either player. One way to look at a weak square is as real estate-you lay claim to it by su­ perior force (money in regard to real estate) and then move one of your guys \"in\", thus treating it as a home for a Knight or some other piece. Ideally, this \"home\" will reside close to or inside enemy territory, thus making your piece difficult to dislodge or remove and, as a result, extremely powerful. This kind of weak square is usually (but not always) \"claimed\" by one of your own pawns, can't be protected by the defender's pawns and, more often than not, is referred to as a \"hole.\" RULE Placing a piece on a square where it doesn't work with the rest of its army is rarely a good idea. Diagram 239 White to move Find the holes Aside from the fact that d6-pawn is a weak backward pawn on an open file, there are also a plethora of holes in the position: b6, b5, b4, d5, e4, f5, h5, and h4. Note that d4 isn't a hole because white's pawn on e3 is protecting it (I should add that Black can't reach it with a piece in any case). The listed squares, though, are the ones that completely fit our \"hole\" criteria: --.... Though b4 is a hole in white's camp, Black has no way to make use of it. On the other hand, the b5-square/hole fits in nicely with white's designs against the weak pawn on d6-a timely Nd5-c3-b5 followed by doubling or tripling on the d-file will exert maximum pressure against black's poor backward pawn. PART FIVE I TA RGET CONSCIOUSNESS 249 __ .... The d5-hole has already been claimed by white's Knight, but the Knight is actually blocking its own Rooks' access to d6. Though strong on d5, it would be better served on the e4- and/or f5-holes (or b5, as mentioned in the previous paragraph) where it would join in the battle against d6. The e4-hole is easy to access via Nd5-c3 -e4 (once the Queen moves away), but the holes on f5 and h5 are extremely difficult for the horse to reach (black's pawn on f4 keeps the Knight out of its jump-squares on e3 and g3). Thus, though there are quite a few holes, the only ones that can really make a difference in white's plans against d6 are b5 and e4, while the d5-hole might turn into a home for a white Rook. __ .... The b6-square is weak, but it doesn't have anything to do with white's general plan of pressuring the d6-pawn. Just because a piece can live on an advanced square doesn't mean that it should. Let me stress a point that has been repeatedly made throughout the book: Placing a piece on a square where it doesn't work with the rest of its army is rarely a good idea. Chess is a team game and you want as many pieces as pos­ sible to work towards the same goal! A possible sequence from diagram 239 is: l.Nc3 (l.Rhl followed by h4 is another strong idea, but let's keep things simple and within our basic theme) l.. .Re6 (Better is the passive 1.. .Bf8 followed by holding on like grim death as White builds up his army against d6) 2.Rd5 Rf8 (Dreaming of counterplay down the f-file) 3.Rcdl Qe7 4.Qd3 fxe3 5.fxe3 Qf7 6.Rfl Rf6 7.Qdl and the threat of Ne4 is devastating. Now let's look at a position that seems similar, but is actually a totally differ­ ent animal. Diagram 240 Black to move All the holes that were so graphically displayed in diagram 239 no longer exist! The b5- and d5 -squares can both be made inaccessible to white's pieces 250 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION by ... c7-c6, e4 is now defended by the f5-pawn, and the f5- and h5-squares are firmly defended by the g6-pawn. Mter l...e4 2.f4 c6 3.Nc3 Rd7 followed by ... Red8, Black is for choice due to his strong Bishop, the fact that white's Knight no longer has any advanced squares to enjoy, and his mobile center which can kick into action at some point via ... d6-d5. More often than not, experienced opponents won't knowingly create a hole in their own position without good reason. Nevertheless, holes are often handed to you on a silver platter, but you can only get mileage out of such mistakes if you notice how to create them and make use of the opportunity presented. Diagram 241 K. Kuenitz (1730) - B. Buggs (1632), Las Vegas 2008 Black to move White has the better position and Black, an attacking player, decided that, \"Enough is enough! It's time to get something going.\" 1 ... e5 The best move, and the follow-up presents us with a clear look at the sorry state of amateur square awareness. 2.e4? A serious mistake that throws away his advantage and hands it to Black! He should have played 2.dxe6 e.p. (creating a hole on d5!) 2 ... Bxe6 3.e4 (3 .Bf2 !?) 3.. .fxe4 (3 .. .Nh6 4.Bf2) 4.Bxe4 and White retains a plus. 2 ... exf4! The refutation. In the actual game Black played 2 ...

(6.Rab l followed by b2 -b4 is also strong) followed by Qa3 , piling on the pressure against c5 , would have given White a huge advantage. 3.Bxf4 g5! 4.Be3 f4 5.Bf2 Ne5 and Black has suddenly transformed the position and now has a lovely game! His kingside pawn majority promises him PART FI VE I TARGET CONSCIOUSNESS 251 good chances against white's King, and the hole on e5 is a marvelous home for black's Knight, which rules the board from its new central perch. If that seemed a bit complicated for some, let's demonstrate the old \"I'm going to make that square mine\" mentality with a simpler example. Diagram 242 Black to move White's Bishop is a very poor piece, but black's Knight doesn't seem to have an impressive home and B-f4 might give White a little something on the king­ side. However, once you fully embrace your \"inner square,\" the right move will instantly pop into your head. l...b4! You guys that live by the \"Attack his King or live in shame!\" credo and who want to play l.. .f5 here, should study this position carefully. Mter l.. .f5 2.f4 black's King has been weakened and, more im­ portantly, the Tall-Pawn on g2 will suddenly leap into action along the soon-to-be-opened hl -a8 diagonal. 2.£4 This move has its problems, but it's the only way to get counterplay (you can't just sit around and wait to die).

Ra2 4.fxe5 Qxe5 252 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 243 Just four moves after our initial diagram and things have radically changed. Now Black not only has a Rook on the seventh rank, but he is also master of the b4-, d4-, and e5 -squares. Combine all that with the awful thing on g2 and it's clear that white's strategically lost. 5.Qc4 Kg7 6.b4 Re2 7.Rf4 And not 7.bxc5?? Qxg3 . 7 ... Nd4 8.Rhfl Still hoping to stir the pot and create some tactical chances. Simply bad is 8.bxc5 Rc2 9.Qa4 Ne2+ 10.Kh2 Rd2 and the dual threat of ll...Nxf4 and ll ...Nc3 wins material and the game. 8 ...

Do you think you can begin creating weak squares in the enemy camp? If so, you're ready to go a step further-let's take diagram 242 and make a \"slight\" adjustment. Diagram 244 Black to move PART FIVE I TA RGET CONSCIOUSNESS 253 I've added a pair of dark-squared Bishops. This means that White can now exchange his dark-squared Bishop for a black Knight once the d4-square is cleared away by ... b5-b4. One should also note that black's Bishop isn't particularly active. Since Black still wants to dominate d4 and should still be dreaming of creating a superior minor piece, the following move makes a lot of sense: l.. .Bh6! There's nothing wrong with the thematic l.. .b4, but playing a move like l.. .Bh6 shows that you've learned your minor piece lessons (from Part Two) very well. Black offers an exchange of Bishops which would once again lead to a monster Knight (after a subsequent ... b5 -b4) vs. a terrible light-squared Bishop situation. It also tries to turn the inactive g7-Bishop into an active participant in the strategic battle that follows. 2.f4 2.Bxh6 Kxh6 3.f4 b4 4.f5 bxc3 5.Qxc3 and now Black can double Rook on the b-file with 5 ... Rfb8 followed by 6 ... Ra8-a7-b7, or give 5 ... Qf6 a go (we'll discuss the ideas behind this move in our main line). In both cases Black will have all the chances thanks to his superior pawn structure (b3 and d3 are both weak) and far superior minor piece. These favorable imbalances will shine in both the middlegame and the endgame. Note that 2.Bb2 leaves Black completely in charge after 2 ... Be3+ 3.Kh2 b4 4.c4 Ra2 . 2 ... b4 Back to our main theme-the creation of holes on b4 and d4! 3.f5 Bxcl 4.Qxcl bxc3 5.Qxc3 Qf6 An ugly move that's designed to block the f5-pawn's advance to f6 while also preparing to get something started on the g-file. 6.Qd2 6.Qc4 g5 ! is strong for Black. 6 ...

Diagram 245 NN (1 879) - NN (2 118), Los Angeles 2008 Black to move The d4-square would be a great home for black's Knight if it could stay there. But White appears to have his house in order due to the possibility of making d4 hostile to black's pieces via c2-c3 . Thus, at the moment d4 doesn't earn our \"hole\" label. However, there's more regarding the d4-square than meets the eye. Other factors in the position: the a2-pawn is vulnerable, the open d-file has yet to be claimed, and a minor piece battle is under way. l ...

However, as Fischer once said, \"You've gotta give squares to get squares.\" In the present case, the powerful d4-Knight is far superior to the light-squared Bishop. 3 ...

He sees that a2 is weak, so he first freezes it in place (known as \"fixing a weak­ ness\") by making use of the hole on a3, and then he'll prepare to crank up the pressure against a2 . 4.Bd5 Qc7 5.Recl The idea of 5.Recl is to guard the a-pawn laterally by c2-c3 . However, the su­ per Knight and the pressure against a2 promises Black a huge strategic advantage. This means that quiet, static play by White will likely prove insufficient. Be it good or bad, I would have tried 5 .f4, striving to get counterplay on the kingside. 5 ... Qa7 6.c3 bxc3 7.Rxc3 Qa5 S.Rccl Re7 Admirable singleness of purpose!

The f3-pawn, being doubled, is ob­ viously weak but one might think it's safe enough since it's so deep in white's position while black's Bishop is a dark-squared piece and thus can't attack it. However, f4 would be a lovely square for the King since it's not only advanced but also bashing f3. Thus Black plays to get his King there. l. ..

A single weak square, situated on the 4th, 5th, or 6th ranks, allows a Knight (or another piece) to set up shop close to or deep inside the enemy's camp. These things allow your pieces to become stronger than their enemy counterparts. � At times a square isn't weak in the normal sense, but it can still be isolated from the rest of its army and/or claimed by the enemy by the creation of an artificial support point. ' \"> , :;;;:.. Let me stress a point that has been repeatedly made throughout the book: Placing a piece on a square where it doesn't work with the rest of its army is rarely a good idea. Chess is a team game and you want as many pieces as possible to work towards the same goal! For most amateurs, the enemy King is the main target from the first move onwards. However, viewing chess in that way puts blinders over your eyes that not only hampers you from fully embracing new skills and ideas, but also prevents you from appreciating all the subtle, often extremely beautiful, plans and/or strategies in master chess that often have absolutely nothing to do with an attack against the opposing King. So far we've seen a quite a few compelling examples of this positional approach in our study of Target Consciousness (squares and weak pawns), and that same strategic view (imbalances) is more or less the subject of this whole book. But now we're going to address when a player must push positional niceties out the window and go after the King. It's important to take note of the word \"must.\" By \"must,\" I mean that the imbalances are demanding (or perhaps begging, if you rarely obey the imbalances' voice) that you take this particular course. Thus we won't be exploring gambit openings that lead to kingside attacks. Nor will we be studying how to slowly but surely build up for a kingside or queenside assault (countless other books cover \"attacking the King\" very well). Instead, we'll look at the single most common example (in amateur chess) of a King begging to die: the uncastled, central King. Though there are other \"must attack\" cases, I'm going to concentrate on this one because it's my experience that amateurs tend to leave their King in the center far too long. I see it all the time in scholastic events, and even players as high as 2000 often \"forget\" to castle. One gentleman I taught with a 1400 rating simply refused to castle, saying that he was sure his castled King would be surrounded in a corner and mated. So he kept his King in the middle and, predictably, got mated there in game after game. Our basic thesis is this: If your King is safely castled while the opponent's is in the middle of the board, I want you to train your mind to view that central King as a target, and immediately try and ascertain whether there's a way to smite it. At the very least, active play in the center while the enemy's monarch resides there will allow you to make some important gains as he scrambles to get his King to safety. 260 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Here are a few short games by the author that should serve as a warning to those that put off castling, while also showing what one should do if the op­ ponent keeps his King in the center for too long.

By now the reader should know the drill: 1) Seeing that the enemy King has stayed in the center for too long, immediately get excited and target it for destruction; 2) Don't allow him to castle to safety; 3) Bring as many pieces to the embattled area as possible and prepare some form of decisive penetration; 4) Rip open some lines and go for the throat! All of this starts with a simple act of recognition: you train yourself to see red when the enemy King is in the middle, you label it as a target, and then you play with as much energy as possible to take advantage of the situation. 13 ...

Both 19. Qxd3 Qd 1 and 19 .Kg 1 Re l are mate. Of course, a central King isn't always a death sentence. For example, if the center is closed, then a longer than usual stay in the middle might be accept­ able since the enemy pieces can't get into the offending position. And, at times, players of all levels (even grandmasters) will temporarily put off castling since they feel they can make serious gains with other moves. Sometimes this works, and sometimes the sky falls on their head. Either way, a player who has culti­ vated Target Consciousness will instantly be aware of the situation and will look hard for a way to punish his opponent's concept. If you can't punish it, then the opponent's idea is playable and you just go ahead with the game in a normal fashion. However, often you can punish the central King, and when the King hunt starts, the fun begins. J. Silman - R.

It's clear that going after a central King can pay dividends, but at times the cor­ rect path isn't to sound an immediate charge, but to make sure the King remains in the center for as long as possible.

This example once again confirmed that, while mate is the ideal way to pun­ ish a central King, it's usually not so easy to achieve if good defensive skills are demonstrated. However, the attacker is quite happy with any number of concessions (i.e., material or positional advantage) as the defender struggles to get his King to safety. I'll finish our theoretical discussion of \"The central King as a Target\" by shar­ ing a tale about Micky Mills, a class \"C\" player (1 500) who, way back in 1974, had a very poor grasp of attacking fundamentals. I was his teacher and, seeing this flaw, recommended that he read The Art of Attack by Vukovic. Some months after my recommendation, Mills was playing in an open tour­ nament (players of every rating were mixed together) that happened to have a brilliancy prize. There were quite a few strong players, including the U.S. Champion John Grefe and many time U.S. Champion Walter Browne, so ev­ eryone expected one of the \"big guns\" to pick up that cash bonus. Mills was not doing particularly well in the event, and was paired with another \"C\" player. Nobody paid much attention to the game, but after I got home (with Mills, two Senior Masters [2400], and John Grefe in tow) Micky squealed, \"Look at my game! Look at my game! I've played a brilliancy!\" I'm not proud of this, but I have to admit that we all burst into laughter. \"Okay,\" we said in our most sarcastic tone, \"show it to us!\" R. Catig (1 500) - M.

We fell on the floor and laughed uncontrollably. Undaunted, Michael ploughed ahead and simply ignored us. At this point I must ask the reader if he has noticed the flaws in white's posi­ tion? One big problem is that e5 is weak and if that pawn vanishes, then the g7-Bishop will rule the a1-h8 diagonal. However, the other problem is the reason this example is being presented here: white's King is still in the center! 13 ... Be6 We were too busy making fun of Michael to notice 13 ...

What's of particular interest to me is that Mills didn't offer any variations at all as he was playing through the game (nor was he able to defend his moves with actual variations). Instead, he would explain everything he did by naming a pattern that he learned from the aforementioned Vukovic book. Thus we were pelted by verbal nutshells of wisdom like, \"Central King, kill it! \" and \"Ripping open the center!\" and \"Maximizing the activity of my pieces!\" and \"Sacrific­ ing to open lines to his King!\" and \"It's a double attack!\" and \"I'm building a mating net!\" Of course, Mills won the brilliancy prize, and none of us could do anything but applaud him. Few players (of any rating) ever create an evergreen such as this, so he can consider himself blessed. It's truly a fantastic creative effort and, perhaps, the greatest game by a non-master of all time!

PART FIVE I TARG ET CONSCIOUSNESS 273 Summary ====:::::>- Our basic thesis is this: If your King is safely castled while the opponent's is in the middle of the board, I want you to train your mind to view that central King as a target, and immediately try and ascertain whether there's a way to smite it. At the very least, active play in the center while the enemy's monarch resides there will allow you to make some important gains as he scrambles to get his King to safety. ====:::::>- Other things being equal, the side with the vulnerable King will always come in second in a head to head clash. ====:::::>- By now the reader should know the drill: 0 Seeing that the enemy King has stayed in the center for too long, immediately get excited and target it for destruction; 0 Don't allow him to castle to safety; 0 Bring as many pieces to the embattled area as possible and prepare some form of decisive penetration; 0 Rip open some lines and go for the throat! 274 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Target Consciousness - Tests The problems here are all about weak pawns, weak squares, and central Kings.

Usually they love to brag about how attacking is everything to them, while a smaller number pride themselves on a solid grasp of positional concepts. Though there's nothing wrong with enjoying one part of the game over another, if you can't show at least basic skills in both you'll be in for a very rough ride. So a good positional player will find that he's doomed if he doesn't also have a solid grasp of tactics and a feel for chess dynamics, while a good tacti­ cian will be beaten from pillar to post if he is positionally clueless and/or doesn't know a static plus or minus from a hole in the wall. In other words, personal tastes are wonderful, but at least a modicum of balance is key if you want chess success. The positional fantasy is to create long-term static problems in the enemy camp (holes, weak pawns, a material deficit, lack of space, etc.) and then \"massage\" these things while the opponent passively sits around until his position totally collapses into a pile of dust. On the other hand, the tactician dreams of knock­ ing his opponent out with a massive tactical punch, or unleashing a stunning combination that overwhelms his gutted prey. Nice thoughts indeed, and these scenarios do occur quite often at all levels. However, this presupposes that the guy on the other side of the table will stick his chin out to be hit, or that he'll roll into a ball in the face of your positional superiority. But what if the opponent sees your tactical trick coming? What if he realizes that his game is a positional mess and dares to fight back, refusing to go quietly into that dark night? What if he has some favorable imbalances too, and fully intends to make maximum use of them? The best chess games are all about the war of ideas, the battle of imbalances, and the face-to-face struggle of one player's will against the other-if you don't have a fighter's mentality, if you wilt in the face of an opponent who grabs the positive features of his position and comes at you again and again as if he was a rabid dog, then you will find that chess success and real chess enjoyment eludes you. A to-the-death battle of mind and knowledge and skill and heart is what 280 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION And all of this brings us to the enormously important battle of Statics vs. Dynamics-the fight between one side's long-term plusses (we'll concentrate on superior structure here) and the other's short-term, use-them-now-or-die, chances (active pieces, attacking possibilities based on a vulnerable enemy King, or swing-from-the-fence tactics that seemingly appear from nowhere but are actually a logical expression of basic combinative rules). This chapter is designed to make you aware of the eternal war between a \"firm foundation\" (positional/static factors) and a \"firm fist\" (dynamics). It's some­ thing you have to take into account when you build your positional dreams or try to create an attack-will the attack fizzle out and leave you a cropper to the opponent's obvious static gains? Will your obvious structural superiority win out or will it fall on its face when the active enemy pieces invade and conquer? D. Strenzwilk - ].

And what about tripled e-pawns? One can understand white's decision to enter this position-he felt that his structural superiority was so enormous that the position simply had to be better for him. In fact, if one stares at black's pawn structure while refusing to look at anything else, it would be hard not to break out laughing. However, only looking at any position through static-tinted lenses will rarely get the job done. And this begs a question: What about dynamics? And here we arrive at the flaw in white's thinking-he didn't take his opponent's plusses into account! Let's break things down: White: --� Far superior pawn structure. Active Rook (which is rightfully targeting black's weak pawns). Black: --� White's King (which is stuffed into a corner and vulnerable to eventual back rank problems) can't take part in the coming battle (it's a liability), while black's King can give support to e7 and e6 via ... K£7 (it's making itself useful). ••� Black's Rook is also active, and if white's Knight moves then ... Rxc2 turns the Rook into an all-devouring beast. --� The tripled e-pawns aren't as bad as they seem-the e6-pawn in particular supports the d5 -square and allows ... N d5. __ ... Once black's Knight leaps to the wonderful d5-square, it will hammer open the c-file and prove to be far more useful than its white counterpart. Once black's Knight moves, the g7-Bishop will take immediate aim at white's queenside. Conversely, white's Bishop isn't attacking or defending anything and is swishing thin air along the h2-b8 diagonal. Black's a pawn up. To sum up, the real picture is very much in black's favor: it's a battle of white's structural superiority versus black's enormous advantage in dynamics. Note that all of black's pieces are serving an active/dynamic function-his King can defend key points in its camp, while the Rook, Knight, and Bishop will join forces and tear down white's queenside. White's pieces, on the other hand, are all over the place and aren't working together at all. 23 ... Nd5 282 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Active pieces call for active play!

Black realizes that it's better to retain his Knight since its ability to attack any square on the board (compared to a Bishop, which is always stuck on one colored complex) will make it a more flexible piece than white's remaining mi­ nor.

Just because we've been taught that doubled, isolated, and even tripled pawns are bad doesn't necessarily make it so! Don't allow useful guidelines to be turned into gospel. Statics vs. Dynamics in the Openings Of course, the battle of Statics vs. Dynamics regularly occurs at the highest level. And it's very common to see the Static vs. Dynamic paradigm created right in the opening. V. Topalov - L. Aronian, Morelia 2008 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.NB c5 5.g3 cxd4 6.Nxd4 Ne4 7.Qd3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Nc5 9.QB d6 10.Bg2 e5 ll.Qe3 0-0 12.Nb3 Qc7 13.Nxc5 dxc5 14.0-0 Nd7 This is a popular line in the Nimzo-Indian. \"White has the Bishop pair but also has trouble with his pawn structure (the doubled c-pawns are weak). If Black can exchange one of the enemy Bishops or restrain the Bishops' activity in some way, he'll have excellent chances. Since this is clearly a Dynamic (two active Bishops and a lead in development) vs. Static (superior pawn structure for Black) situation, \"White has to insist that his Bishops somehow reach their full potential. 284 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 274 15.f4! This actually makes white's pawn structure even worse (since he'll soon have an isolated e-pawn to go with his isolated a-pawn and doubled isolated c-pawns), but structure isn't on white's mind-activity is! The advance of the f-pawn intends f4-f5 with chances on the kingside. And, if Black captures on f4 (which he does) then the cl -Bishop will join its light-squared brother on a diagonal superhighway. 15 ... exf4 To me, this seems like strategic capitulation since White will achieve all his dynamic goals (of course, it takes some powerful chess by Topalov to prove this). In my view, Black should play 15 ... ReS!?, a move that highlights white's potential problems down the e-file and intends to meet 16.f5 with 16 ... e4!, blocking the g2-Bishop's diagonal.

Many structures become raging Static vs. Dynamic battlefields. One of the most interesting (to me) can be seen in the diagram that occurs after the fol­ lowing eight moves: l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 0-0 6.f3 Ne8 7.e4 b6 8.Bd3 Diagram 277 Black to move If Black wasn't familiar with the general structure in diagram 2 77, he might be tempted to follow up with ... Bb7 followed by ... d6 and ... Nd7. However, those \"normal\" developing moves would demonstrate a complete lack of un­ derstanding about the dynamics/statics of the position. The fact is, this kind of structure (which most commonly occurs in the Nimzo-Indian but can also arise from other openings) is seething with mutual bad intent. White claims two Bishops, a huge pawn center, and kingside attacking chances (dynamics). Black targets the c4-pawn for death (going after a static weakness). Once you realize that c4 is the target, then you will also understand that ... Bb7 can't be right since it has nothing to do with pressuring the c4-pawn. Placing the Knight on d7 is also illogical since it wouldn't be contributing to the \"kill c4\" plan. However, now that black's goal is clear, his moves should also be clear: 8 ... Ba6 (hitting c4) 9.Nh3 Nc6 intending ... Na5 (hitting c4 again). I should also add a bit about the \"bizarre\" move, 6 ... Ne8. Why retreat to a seemingly stupid square when there's no need to do so? As it turns out, e8 is a very flexible square for the Knight-it gets out of the way of its f7 -pawn, which can now help block a white attack by a well-timed . . . f7 -f5 . In some cases, it can PART SIX I STA TICS VS. DYNAMICS 287 add to its King's defenses by ... g6 and ... Ng7. And it can also join in the group assault of c4 by ... Nd6. Take a look at the following game where the same basic structure arises and the same plans are employed (hard to believe they knew this stuff 140 years ago!).

In this game Black had pressure against the c4-pawn (a static structural plus) and eventually won it (gaining a static material plus). However, white's dynamic imbalances turned out to be more important. Our next game, played between two of the greatest players of all time, shows black's static (versus white's dynamic) strategy in a better light. M. Botvinnik - S. Reshevsky, World Chmp Tnmt 1948 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 c5 5.a3 Bxc3 + 6.bxc3 Nc6 7.Bd3 0-0 8.Ne2 b6 9.e4 Ne8 10.Be3 d6 11 .0-0 Na5 12.Ng3 Ba6 13 .Qe2 Qd7 14.f4 Diagram 279 White has-at least temporarily-managed to hold onto c4, and now he's pur­ suing his kingside dreams via the threat of f4-f5.

DYN AMICS 289 Freezing white's f-pawn and thus turning it into a traitor-the white f-pawn now blocks its dark-square Bishop while black's f-pawn makes sure that white's light-squared Bishop and g3 -Knight will never be able to use the e4-square. Thus white's minor pieces now find themselves trapped in a sort of cage. A common (and often strong) maneuver in this kind of position is 14 ... Qa4, bringing another piece to bear on c4. However, though it succeeds in tearing down c4 (the final realization of his static plan), it also lets White continue with his dynamic kingside plans via 15 .f5. This advance gains kingside space, frees the e3-Bishop by opening up the c 1-h6 diagonal, and also brings the previously dead fl -Rook into the game. Is rushing to win c4 really worth giving White all of this activity? A possible continuation would then be 15 ... Bxc4 16.fxe6 and now Black can try: 16 ...

It gives the reader a better understanding about the potential of active, unleashed pieces. IN A NUTSHELL Statics tend to last longer than dynamics. 15.Rael Of course, Reshevsky was having none of it! His plan was to snuff out this dynamic potential before finalizing his evil, static designs against c4. 15.d5, trying to break down f5, seems logical but it fails to 15 ... fxe4 16.Nxe4 exd5 17.cxd5 Bxd3 1S.Qxd3 Qf5 19.c4 Nf6 (Kasparov) 20.Nxf6+ Rxf6 when White no longer has doubled pawns, but c4 is still weak and white's dynamic potential is a thing of the past. In other words, white's dynamic chances have vanished while black's static edge remains. That's one of the nice things about being on the side of statics: they tend to last a long, long time while dynamics are like a flare that burns bright for a few moments before fading into oblivion. After 20 ... Rxf6 21 Rxf5 22 .Racl ReS 23 .Bd2 Nb3 leaves Black in charge, while 21.

However, it's already been made clear that Reshevsky had no intention of letting white's pieces out of their cage. 17.e5 This turns f5 into a permanent rock and dooms white's pieces to long-term passivity. Like it or not, White had to give 17.d5 Ng7 a try. 17 ...

Black's last two moves have permanently killed white's kingside hopes. Now all Botvinnik can do is hold on tight and hope that Reshevsky can't find a decisive continuation.

It's critically important to know if the position demands static or dynamic play from you. At times there might be a choice about which direction you'll take, but more often than not, the writing is on the wall and there's only one correct decision. Ultimately, taking that correct path is dependent on you looking for it in the first place, and a correct reading of the imbalances. Done right, the board will usually scream (quite loudly!) what's expected of you. A. Volokitin - A.

DYN AMICS 295 tells us that Black will have a long-term static plus (play against the isolated d­ pawn and the weakened d5-square) while White will find dynamic compensation in active pieces and chances against the enemy King. This generic scenario would indeed play out if Black played the natural posi­ tional move, 11 ... c6, giving support to the d5 -square and intending to follow up with ... Nbd5. Since normal moves like 12.Re 1 Nbd5 13 .Ne5 give Black a com­ fortable game after 13 ... Be6, White might be tempted to slam down 12 .Bxh6!? gxh6 13 .Qg6+ Kh8 14.Qxh6+ (14.Bxf7 Nh7 15.Ne5 ExeS 16.dxe5 Qe7 favors Black since 17.e6? is met by 17 ... Bxe6! 18.Bxe6 Rf6) 14 ... Nh7, though it's more or less equal after 15.Ne4 Be7, giving us a nice example of black's static material plus vs. white's dynamic (attacking) chances. I think most players would toss out 11 ... c6 if they were sure that 12 .Bxh6 wasn't dangerous (and, as the above analysis shows, this would be a fully accept­ able decision). But it turns out that Black doesn't have to accept his static role, and can actually change the \"personalities\" of both sides with a rather surprising (non-dogmatic) move. ll...Be6! Black accepts a weakening of his structure for iron control over the d5 -square and use of the just-opened f-file. This dynamic, original decision creates a posi­ tion that very much suits Morozevich's original, active style. Suddenly White (who a moment ago was the active one) has static play against the weakness on e6 while black's active (dynamic) pieces will give him chances of his own. 12.Bxe6 fxe6 13.Rel Qe8 Not too subtle. Black envisions his Queen leaping to h5 and chomping down on white's King. A more restrained interpretation of black's plan would be 13 ... Qd7 14.Ne4 Nxe4 15 .Qxe4 Rae8 with a solid, completely acceptable position. However, Morozevich most likely wanted to make the game as sharp as pos­ sible, thinking that his fourteen­ year-old opponent wouldn't be able to handle the heat. IN A NUTSHELL Note that White has to be careful not to let Black create (by swapping one of his Knights for a white Knight and his d6-Bishop for the other white Knight) a monster Knight (firmly entrenched on d5) versus an inferior Bishop scenario. 14.Ne4 Nbd5 15.Nc5 Bxc5 16.dxc5 Nd7 17.Qc2 The critical move was 17 .c6, shredding black's pawn structure. After 17 ... bxc6 18.Nd4? ! (18.Qe4 is best, with a small but annoying static edge) 18 ... Qf7 19.f3 cS is nothing for White since 20.Nxe6??

Summary � This chapter is designed to make you aware of the eternal war between a \"firm foundation\" (positional/static factors) and a \"firm fist\" (dynamics). � Battle of statics vs. dynamics-the fight between one side's long-term plusses and the other's short-term, use-them-now­ or-die, chances (active pieces, attacking possibilities based on a vulnerable enemy King, or swing-from-the-fence tactics that seemingly appear from nowhere but are actually a logical expression of basic combinative rules). � Dynamics can beat statics and statics can beat dynamics. It's up to the player to judge which is of more value in the particular position. � One of the nice things about being on the side of statics is that they tend to last a long, long time while dynamics are like a flare that burns bright for a few moments before fading into oblivion. � Conversely, dynamics can sometimes light up the board when you thought you had a static lock! � It's critically important to know if the position demands static or dynamic play from you. � At times there might be a choice about which direction (Statics or Dynamics) you'll take, but more often than not, the writing is on the wall and there's only one correct decision. � A dynamic plus is often cashed in for a longer lasting static plus. � The transformation of one kind of imbalance (static or dynamic) into another kind of imbalance (dynamic or static) is very common. 298 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Statics vs .

Doubled and/or isolated pawns-yes. All these things are solid-you can capture material, you can win weak pawns, and you can place a huge X on the head of the enemy King and embrace an all-out seek-and-destroy operation against it. But space? Is it really that important? The answer, of course, is a resounding \"Yes!\" Ask players who have been squeezed to death by Petrosian, Karpov, or Seirawan-all masters of spatial gains-just how important it is. In fact, an advantage in space is one of the most highly prized imbalances among modern grandmasters. And this pep talk takes us to a short but critical question: \"Why?\" Let's answer this with a visual image-a large guy staying in an average sized hotel room for twenty-four hours is, more or less, comfortable. But take that same person and cram him into a airplane bathroom and you'll see him falling apart both physi­ cally and emotionally-locked into such a small space, you can hardly move, there's nowhere to go, and little can be done. Now imagine putting your opponent into that same situation on a chessboard. His pieces have little scope. There's no room to maneuver, and his Bishops, Knights, and Rooks tend to get in each other's way. You take your time, improving the position of your pawns and pieces at leisure, watching your opponent's face for signs of impending emotional collapse. He's uncomfortable, helpless, and all he can do is sit there and hope you can't find a way to deliver a deathblow. Who wouldn't feel despair when living out such a scenario? PHILOSOPHY All of history's great positional players coveted space because it deprives the opponent of room and dooms his pieces to a life of inactivity. Embracing a love of space is a must for players that want to improve their game. 304 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION What is important is to acquire a feel (and respect!) for the power of space and how it's there to be used for players of any level.

White's Knight has moved four times so that it could exchange itself for an enemy Knight that has never moved at all! On the surface, such a thing seems nonsensical, but there's a deep positional reason for white Knight's journey to b8: by ridding Black of his last Knight, White intends to create a closed position where Knights are superior to Bishops! 13 ... Rfxb8 14.h4 SECOND SPATIAL GAIN: This very useful move gains kingside space and also prepares to get the g2-Bishop outside the pawn chain by Bh3 _ Black will then be in a bit of a quandary: his light-squared Bishop is dead in the water on a6 or b 7, but if he allows the exchange of light-squared Bishops by ...

The best result he can realistically hope for is a draw-not a happy prospect for anyone! PART SEVEN I SPACE 305 Diagram 293 Killing queenside counterplay Karpov shuts down all of black's queenside possibilities. Note that ... b6-b5 is now impossible, and ... c7 -c6 creates (after White captures on c6) pawn weak­ nesses on b6 and d6 and also hands the d5-square to white's Knight. Spatial_�oundup: White has more space on the queenside, but he also has an obvious advantage in space in the center and on the kingside! What does this mean for each side's chances? It doesn't bode well for Black! The second player's problem is that he can't initiate active play anywhere on the board. The queenside offers a long-term white plus (thanks to a possible b2-b4 advance), and the other two zones (center and kingside) belong to White thanks to his extra territory in those areas. lS ...

It also gobbles up a bit more kingside space by grabbing hold of the f5-square. 16 . . . h5 17.0-0-0 Diagram 294 Pawn breaks are lurking 306 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION If Black has no way of opening up the queenside, then white's King will feel very safe there. This also allows White to play for line-opening breaks on the kingside, since his own King will be safely entrenched on the other wing. Now it's time to discuss pawn breaks. In a closed position, pawn breaks are necessary to open lines for attack and to open files so the Rooks can join in the action. Let's look at each side's possibilities: Black: __ ..._ An eventual ... g7-g5 destroys black's own kingside pawn protection and is a suicidal idea. ----- The ... f7-f5 advance is the natural break in such a position (black's c7-d6-e5 pawn chain points to the kingside, which White: usually means that this is where he wants to play). However, the advance of the f-pawn (after the Bishop moves to d8 or e7 or, after ... g6, to g7) carries some serious baggage here-it further loosens black's kingside pawn cover, it allows White (after exf5) to claim e4 as a home for his Knight, and in many lines it simply helps White penetrate to the black King. Sacrificing via ... b6-b5 might be good at the right time, but only if a series of tactics somehow justify it. At the moment, and for the next few moves, that will most likely not be the case. The only break left is ... c7-c6-whether it's good or bad, it probably should be given a try. Better to fight like a cornered badger than to wait around and let the boa swallow you whole. Here's a sample of what could happen: 17 ... c6 18.dxc6 Qxc6 19.b3 Qc5 20.Kb2 (20.Bf3 Rfd8 21 .Bxh5 ? b5!

In fact, if it isn't dealt with properly, the side with less space can easily end up with a passive, cheerless position. __ .... In closed positions, the side with more pawn breaks is the side with the ability to call the shots. --.... Cat and Mouse is a strategy where your opponent is helpless. In such situations, barring a forced win, it's often good to \"Do in twenty what you could do in two.\" In other words, take 310 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION your time and let your opponent enjoy the full bouquet of his position's misery. If you possess an advantage in space, don't forget about the other imbalances. For example, playing for a superior minor piece can be a useful compliment to your territorial gains. Here's an example where spatial gains push a position already ravaged by positional weaknesses over the brink. A. Onischuk - J. Peters, Western States Open 2001 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 S.NB 0-0 6.Be2 e5 7.Be3 Ng4 8.Bg5 f6 9.Bcl Nh6 10.dxe5 fxe5 ll .c5! Diagram 298 Creating a weakness in the enemy camp This pawn advance is a thematic, very strong idea in the King's Indian Defense. The move not only vacates the c4-square for white's light-squared Bishop, but it also intends to capture on d6 and leave Black with either an isolated e-pawn (if Black recaptures with the Queen or Knight) or a backward d-pawn (if he recaptures with the c-pawn). 11 .c5 nicely illustrates the creation of weak pawns/squares-don't expect them to just magically appear! ll. ..

As wonderful as white's position is, the d6-pawn is solidly defended and no instantly decisive blow can be found.

White's central and queenside space advantage, and the difference in piece activity that was a result of it, made his 312 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION grandmaster strength opponent look like a child. Lack of space has brought many great players to their knees! In the Onischuk - Peters game, black's pieces were smothered by his lack of space. In a way, I'm reminded of a Volkswagen Bug and how \"bug\" addicts would IN A NUTSHELL cram as many people as possible into that small space (I think the record was 27). Being in the filled up car would be intolerable, but reduce the number to three or \"I got a backward d-pawn and a miserably passive position. At the end, I can barely move:' -Peters. RULE four and all would be well. The idea of the spactially challenged side making a few exchanges so that his remaing pieces have room to maneuver is useful in all stages of the game. Here's a typical opening example: l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.f4 Bg7 8.Bh5+ Nfd7 9.a4 0-0 lO.NB Na6 11 .0-0 Nb4 12.Rel a6 Diagram 300 White to move and avoid exchanges White enjoys much more central space.

At the moment, white's light-squared Bishop is under attack and has to move. 13 .Bc4 has been played from time to time, but 13 .Bfl is recognized as correct. Why? Because 13 .Bc4 gives Black time to free his Bishop and trade it It's usually a good idea for the side with more space to avoid unnecessary exchanges. off: 13 ...

Nf6 14.h3 ! when Black is forced to continue suf- fering from a certain amount of claustrophobia. The idea that the side with more territory should avoid unnecessary exchanges might lead one to believe that space won't be of much use in an endgame since PART SEVEN I SP ACE 313 many exchanges would have been made to reach that stage. However, this simply isn't the case. Diagram 301 V. Kramnik - M. Illescas, Dos Hermanas 1997 White to move White has an obvious advantage in space and two Bishops. Though the po­ sition is rather closed (a situation that usually makes Knights happy), black's horses aren't doing much of anything due to the fact that they don't have access to any advanced support points (d4 can't be reached, and an immediate jump to e5 allows White to chop it off with advantage). White is clearly better, but it will take time and patience to actually win. l.Nbl! A star move. The Knight is heading for c3 where it stops black's planned ... Nc7 followed by ... d6-d5-the white Knight also intends to continue on to a4 where the d 7-Knight will be frozen guarding b6. Some players might ask why this is a big deal, since white's Knight on a4 will be as \"frozen\" as black's on d7. That's an astute observation, but there's a flaw: once those Knights reach that faceoff position, the d7 -Knight will need to be protected from attacks by white's light-squared Bishop. Thus, black's one active plan of ... d6-d5 won't work since exd5 followed by Bh3 forces the win of b6. What all this means is that Black now finds himself with a situation we've seen before: no space, passive pieces, no play, and little hope. l.. .Bb7 l.. .Ne5 2.Bxe5 dxe5 3.Nc3 Nd6 4.Na4 Nc8 5.Bh3 K£8 6.f4 exf4 7.gxf4 is a clear advantage for White - Kramnik. 2.f4 Taking more space and also depriving the enemy Knights of the use of the e5-square.

However, far more common are positions where both sides have space in differ­ ent sectors of the board. For example, in the King's Indian Defense it's common for White to have a huge queenside space advantage (which often allows him to ravage Black on that wing and also to have a marked advantage in most end­ games), while Black counters with serious spatial gains on the kingside, which leads to a strong attack against the white King. l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.Nf3 e5 7.0-0 Nc6 8.d5 Ne7 Diagram 304 In closed positions, you usually want to play where your pawn chain \"points': When playing this variation, both sides pretty much know what's expected of them. The center is closed so play has to be found on the wings. In such positions, you usually want to play on the side where you have more space (of course, there are exceptions-don't treat any rule as gospel). Once you determine which side that is, you will try and create weaknesses in the enemy camp, use pawn advances to gain even more territory in your chosen sector, and employ pawn breaks to crack open files for the Rooks so you can use them to penetrate into the hostile position. The following common sequence shows how each side goes about their business: 9.Nel The Knight heads for d3 where it will help make the space gaining (and file opening) c4-c5 push possible. In general, your space lies where your pawn chain points-to add to your space (and rip open files) in that area, you need to push the pawn that's next to your lead pawn. In white's case the lead pawn is d5 and the pawn you want to push (since e4-e5 is impossible) is the c-pawn. In black's case the lead pawn is on e5 and the pawn next to it is the f-pawn. Thus, both sides will make use of a Pawn Cascade: White will play c4-c5 (lay­ ing claim to the queenside) and Black will play ... f7 -f5 (beginning a kingside attack). 9 ... Nd7 PART SEVEN I SP ACE 317 RULE The use of Pawn Cascades allows you to gain extra space and create open files so your Rooks can penetrate into the enemy position. Black's Knight gets out of the way of its f-pawn and also eyes the c5 -square, temporarily making the c4-c5 push harder to achieve. 10.Nd3 Continuing to prepare the critical c4-c5 push. 10 ... £5 Black's kingside space advantage is now clear. 1l.Bd2 Developing and preparing to bring the a1 -Rook to c1 in anticipation of that file opening after c4-c5. 1l. ..Nf6 Black wants to annex even more kingside space with ... f5-f4, but that move doesn't work right away due to 12 .Bg4! when the eventual exchange of light­ squared Bishops will severely hamper black's kingside attack. 11 ... Nf6 attacks e4 and forces White to address that threat by either taking on f5 or, more com­ monly, defending the e-pawn with f2-f3. 12.f3 f4 Now this move works since Bg4 is no longer legal. 13.c5 Both sides achieved their optimum pawn advances. 13 ... g5 . Now the furthest pawn in the chain is f4, so Black wants to push his g-pawn to g4 and open a file right in the face of white's King! 14.cxd6 Opening up the c-file. 14 ... cxd6 15.Rcl Ng6 with the beginning of an exciting battle between white's queenside attack and black's kingside attack. 318 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Our next two examples show these ideas at play.

So sit back and enjoy the intensity of this war of ideas, and pay special attention to both side's adher­ ence to their respective goals.

The idea of playing where your pawn chain points, and of pushing the pawn next to your lead pawn so that more space can be gained and files opened, is an oft-seen theme in several structures. The following game shows the Pawn­ Pointing Rule and the idea of Pawn Cascades were both understood even in the 1600s! G. Greco - NN, Europe 1620 l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Diagram 307 320 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION This well-known line in the French Defense features a clear illustration of pawn chains pointing in different directions and how the structure generally dictates the way each side will play. Black's f7 -e6-d5 pawn chain points to the queenside while white's b2-c3 -d4-e5 chain is taking aim at the kingside. In fully closed positions, this would indicate that Black would eventually attack on the queenside with pawns via ... c5-c4 followed by ... b7 -b5-b4 (taking huge amounts of space and opening up files for the Rooks). White's plan would be an eventual f2-f4-f5, trying to crash through on the opposite wing. However, the French center isn't necessarily doomed to permanent closure, and this means that both sides have other options. In fact, Black usually makes use of a plan based on pressure against d4 via ... Nc6, ... Qb6, and ... Ng8-e7-f5 with a true team effort against white's d-pawn! In this line, ... Bd7 and ... Rc8 also allows Black chances along the c-file once he opens it with ... cxd4. Finally, in many lines Black can strike at e5 too with a well-timed ... f7-f6 punch. White, of course, enjoys a central space advantage and usually tries to stabilize it with NB , Be2, 0-0 and, at times, even Nb l-a3 -c2 giving d4 plenty of support! In some cases White can pursue a kingside attack with pieces (Qg4 and/or Bd3) and at other times he can play to occupy d4 with a piece via a well-timed dxc5 following by plonking down a Knight on the newly freed up square. 4 ... cxd4 5.cxd4 Bh4+ 6.Nc3 Bxc3 + 7.bxc3 Black's last few moves were pretty bad (What did you expect from an unknown foe in 1620?), and his rushed exchanges have turned the potential target on d4 into an unassailable rock. This doesn't mean that Black's devoid of certain posi­ tive imbalances and a clear plan: the c3 -pawn is backward and can be attacked by placing a Rook (or the Queen) on the half-open c-file. The c4-square is also vulnerable, and can be occupied by an eventual ... Nb8-c6-a5-c4. Be that as it may, White is much better in this position. He still enjoys a spatial plus in the center and on the kingside. He has two active Bishops-the light­ squared Bishop will sit on d3 and send out rays of power along two diagonals (fl -a6 and bl-h7), while the dark-squared Bishop might eventually set up shop on a3 and lay claim to the entire a3 -f8 diagonal. And, in case you've forgotten, the f2-f4-f5 Cascade idea is still there, waiting to be utilized. 7 ... Nc6 8.Bd3 8.Qg4! ? was worth considering, forcing Black into unsavory choices such as ... Kf8 or ... g6 (which weakens all the dark-squares). Note that 8.Qg4 Qa5 9.Bd2 would leave Black with the same problem as before. 8 ... Nge7 9.f4 Dreaming of an eventual f4-f5 Pawn Cascade. Of course, if the f4-f5 advance doesn't occur, then the f4-pawn can actually hurt White by blocking his Bishop's PART SEVEN I SP ACE 321 control of the cl-h6 diagonal. Personally, I would have preferred 9.Qg4 Qa5 10.Bd2 0-0 11.NB with a nice attacking position for White. 9 ... Nf5 10.Nf3 0-0 Allowing White to make his hoped for Cascade a reality.

The legendary Greco ate up his overmatched foe. We've seen the benefits that an advantage in space bestows upon its owner. However, this doesn't mean that the spatially challenged player has to roll over and die. In general, there are four ways to deal with space: Exchange pieces so your limited territory is no longer uncomfortable. Use pawn breaks to crack his seemingly indestructible pawn-fa<;ade. Try and prove that your opponent's gain in space has left weak squares in its wake. ••� Treat a space-gaining enemy pawn center as a target! Exchange Piec�� We've already discussed piece exchanges as a means of soothing the pain of a constricted position. Here's a basic example: Diagram 309 Black to move White enjoys more central and queenside space, and he also has a very good Bishop while black's is seemingly inactive (of course, if black's a-pawn was on a6 and white's a-pawn on aS then the black Bishop would be a true Tall-Pawn and white's advantage would be decisive). 324 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Here we'll let a couple rules guide us: \"Trade bad minor pieces for good ones\", \"Get your Bishop outside the pawn chain\", and \"Exchange pieces when you have less space.\" With so many rules smacking us in the face, black's move is a no-brainer! l ...

After ll .K£2 Rxd4 White will draw, but Black can play on a bit and let his opponent grovel before making peace. As you can see, black's game is actually easier to handle since in some lines the white King can find itself in an uncomfortable situation. 7 . . . Kf7 Black's King needs to be able to defend d7 in many lines. 8.Kf2 a6 Though this looks stupid, it's actually quite useful! The idea is that if and when White captures black's a-pawn, the capturing piece would also attack d7 if the pawn stood on a 7. Thus, by placing it on a6 Black will gain a tempo since guarding d7 won't be immediately necessary. 9.Qa5 9.g4!? might be white's best, though 9 ... g6 promises Black a trouble free game. 9 ... h6 10.Ke3 10.h4!? 10 ... g5 ll .g3 PART SEVEN I SPACE 325 ll .fxg5 hxg5 12 .Kd2 Qb5 13 .Qxb5 Rxb5 14.Kc3 a5 15.Ra2 Kg6 and the Black King has dreams of marching in via ...

Use Pawn Breaks! ----- A pawn break is the weapon of choice when facing an opponent who gleefully marches his pawns forward in an attempt to annex every square on the board. A pawn break either challenges your opponent's advanced structure head on, or maps out its own space in another sector. Here's an easy-to-understand example of how a pawn break works. Diagram 311 SinEater7 - DLJ, Internet game 2006 Black to move 326 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION White, seeing that he could grab queenside space, has just played c4-c5. It turns out that if white's a1 -Rook was protected, then this advance would be worthy of at least some consideration. However, the a 1-Rook isn 't protected, and thus the space-gaining advance of the c-pawn is simply a mistake. I'll explain this cryptic comment about the undefended a 1-Rook in the note to black's second move. This kind of error is made all the time on the amateur level, so it's very im­ portant for the student to become familiar with the antidote. l. .. b6! This pawn break, which directly challenges the c5-pawn's right to be on that square, refutes white's idea. Now 2.cxb6 is pretty much forced, though both 2 ... axb6 and 2 ... Qxb6 give Black a very nice position. To understand why having to play 2.cxb6 is a slap in the face for White, take a look at the position after l.c5. Which pawn is more valuable, white's c5-pawn or black's a 7 -pawn? Clearly, the more central c-pawn is far better than the thing on a7 (in general, center pawns are more valuable than wing pawns). Next, look at the position after 2 .cxb6 axb6. In effect, White has exchanged his c-pawn for black's a-pawn! So, by playing 1.c5, White lost a tempo to trade his c-pawn for black's a-pawn, while also opening up a file for the previously \"dead\" Rook on a8! It's clear that White is a very nice person! Of course, White didn't play 1.c5 to swap it off for a wing pawn. He intended to keep his c-pawn on c5 by giving it support. Thus he now compounds his problems with the logical but tactically flawed 2.b4. 2.b4? a5! Diagram 312 White loses material Believe it or not, White is actually losing material here! Why? Because his whole queenside structure can't be maintained, and this takes us back to the \"undefended a 1-Rook\" comment. If the a 1-Rook was on b 1 or if white's Bishop was on b2 (defending the Rook), then 3 .a3 would support all the pawns. However, PART SEVEN I SPACE 327 since the Rook isn't defended, 3.a3 fails to 3 ... axb4 when White can't recapture because of the pin on the a-file. It's critical that you fully understand why white's game is falling apart, so please explore this position again and again until it all makes perfect sense. 3.Qa4 A noble try, but it's already too late to stop the bleeding. Note that 3.cxb6 axb4 leaves Black a full pawn ahead since the b6-pawn will soon be removed from the board. Also, 3.Ba3 Na6 wins a pawn since it simultaneously attacks both b4 and c5. 3 ... Ba6 Black is up to the challenge and finds the best move. White still can't avoid losing a pawn. 4.a3 Poor SinEater7 is still dreaming of holding his pawn chain together. Unfor­ tunately, his fantasies are about to come face to face with reality. 4 ... Bb5! 5.Qb3 axb4 6.Qxb4 bxc5 7.dxc5 Na6 8.Qb2 Nxc5 and white's dead lost-he's a pawn down, his a-pawn is weak, and he is way behind in development. Now let's take a look at the same general structure, but this time White will­ ingly plays c4-c5, knowing he can't maintain the advanced c-pawn. A. Komev - S. Rublevsky, Russia 2007 l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 a6 5.Nc3 e6 6.c5 b6 The thematic pawn break. As in our previous example, 7.b4 fails to 7 ... a5. 7.cxb6 Diagram 313 The space-gaining c5 -pawn has been forced off its perch, but white's positional idea is crystal clear: he wants to follow up with Na4, Bd2, and Rcl with control over the hole on c5 and pressure against the backward pawn on c6. Black, of course, doesn't allow this to happen. 328 HOW TO REASSESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITION 7 ...

Nxb6 9.Bd2 Nxa4 10.Qxa4 Bd7 ll.Ne5 c5 If White had been able to freeze black's c-pawn on c6, then he would have stood better. However, the \"weak\" pawn is anything but the helpless target White had hoped it would be-instead of letting the pawn sit passively in place, Black challenges for queenside space via a second pawn break. 12.Nxd7 Qxd7 13.Qxd7+ Kxd7 14.dxc5 Bxc5 15.Rcl Rhc8 16.Bd3, 1h-1h. Not a very exciting example (to say the least!), but it does illustrate the useful­ ness of pawn breaks as a means of freeing a position that's somewhat spatially challenged. So far we've seen pawn breaks with ... b6, _ .. a5, ... c5, and (in the King's Indian) ... f5 mixed with ... g5-g4. One other major break (White, of course, has his own series of breaks in different positions, but once you master the ideas behind the typical black breaks, the white breaks will be easy to find) is the ... e7-e5 break. Here's a rather frenetic example. W.G. Hansen - D. Ciric, Politiken Cup 1989 l.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.c4 Nf6 5.c5 Not a very good move since White is going after space before he's even developed one single piece! 5 ... e5 Diagram 314 Ripping white's space gaining structure to bits Black had other reasonable moves (5 ... b6 is our usual response in this kind of position, while the patient 5 ... g6 has also been played), but 5 ... e5 is clearly the most challenging and extreme attempt to refute white's c5-push.

Armed with all these pawn break patterns, let's look at a heavyweight example that mixes them together. G. Kaidanov - V.

Aside from mere space, the 12 .g4/13 .h4 pawn-duo intends to sweep Black away on the kingside. The idea is that Black seems devoid of counterplay, which means White will have a free hand on either wing. However, things aren't that simple. Though black's normal ... b 7 -b6 break has been rendered innocuous for the moment (opening the c-file so the cl -Rook stares at c6 seems more than a little risky), he's poising himself to smash open the center with the other thematic pawn break, ... e6-e5. 15 ...

Gains in Sp���.� Pote!!t!!L�eak Squares Pawns protect squares. This seems obvious, but it's something that needs to be pondered and appreciated since many players forget that as pawns advance, the potential amount of squares they control diminishes. This means that as a player pushes his pawns and gains more and more space with them, he is also potentially leaving weakened squares in their wake. Diagram 320 r--------------------------------------- ' PART SEVEN I SP ACE 333 The e2-pawn potentially controls all the squares with Xs. However, if you push it to e3 then it loses contact with d3 and f3. If it moves to e4, it's already lost the potential to control d3, d4, f3, and f4. In general, the other pawns can take up the slack created by the advance of the e-pawn. For example, pushing the e2-pawn to e4 gives up control over d3, d4, f3, and f4, but the c2-pawn will take over defensive duty for d3 and d4, while the g2 -pawn does the same for f3 and f4. However, if White goes for a big pawn center via c2-c4, d2 -d4, and e2-e4, pawn control over d3 and d4 is forever lost. It's these \"lost\" squares that can (and often do) fall into enemy hands when a player, failing to recognize the pitfalls of indiscriminate pawn advances, grabs too much space for his own good. I'm going to annotate the following game in a very strange way-variations will be ignored, and commentary as to whether a move is good or bad will also be passed over. Instead, I'll concentrate on three squares ( c5, d3, and f4), how white's pawn moves ultimately gave them up, and how black's pieces and pawns are fighting for them. J. R. Capablanca - R. T. Black, New York (simultaneous exhibition) 191 1 l.e4 The e-pawn has soared past the d3- and f4-squares, leaving only the c2 -pawn to care for d3 and the g2-pawn to nurture f4. l...c5 2.b4 cxb4 One of the guardians of c5 (white's b-pawn) has already fallen. 3.a3 bxa3 4.Bxa3 d6 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.d4 g6 7.h4 Bg4 8.c3 It's not important at the moment, but the d3 -square is now permanently bereft of the protection of a white pawn. 8 ...

Kxh6 26.Qd2+ Kh7 27.f4 e5 An excellent move. The cS -square was made persona non grata to the b7-Knight by the d4-pawn. So Black wisely removes it. 28.fxe5 dxe5 29.d5 Nc5 Diagram 322 The eagle has landed! The eagle has landed! On top of its domination of cS, the Knight is also eyeing d3 (a square that the c4- and e4-pawns can see in their rearview mirrors, but can never touch). The weakness of our three squares of note (c5, d3, and f4) is beginning to play a key role in the game. 30.Qe2 Qe7 3l .Bf5 Kg7 32.Rc3 Rh8 33 .Rg3 Rh6 34.Qe3 Qf6 35.Rhgl Kh7 36.Rg5 gxf5 37.Rxf5 Qe7 38.Qf3 f6 39.Rxh5 Nd3+ Black's Knight wants to singlehandedly taste all three squares.

A fitting end-black's Queen also makes use of the hole on c5. Hopefully this game made you more aware of the potential dangers of pushing a pawn! Of course, pushing your pawns and creating squares that might prove weak later in the game is unavoidable. The key here is awareness-as long as you know the downside of every pawn advance, you'll be able to better judge whether or not such a square will really to be a problem as the game progresses. I.

White's central space ad­ vantage is obvious, and so is his plan: to advance the e4-pawn to e5 and, perhaps, onwards to e6! At the moment Black has prevented this, but the simple Rae l will give the e5-push a green light. What can Black do to stop his opponent's idea in its tracks? 19 ... c4! Black places his finger on a weakness that White never knew he had-the d3 -square! This is a natural result of the c2-c4 and e2-e4 moves, which left d3 without a natural pawn defender. Now ...

PART SEVEN I SP ACE 337 A SEace-Gaining Pawn Center Might be a Target Space is created by the expansion of pawns. If you think of a line of pawns as a fence, you will easily understand the concept of the territory behind your \"fence\" being yours. In the 1800s and early 1900s, a big pawn center was thought to be advantageous in almost every situation. How could a constricting pawn fence not be good? However, in the 1920s a group of players (Nimzovich, Reti, Alekhine, Bogoljubov, Gruenfeld, and Breyer) turned this \"pawn center is good\" mentality on its head. These \"Hypermoderns\" realized that one could allow the opponent to build away like a demented beaver, only to have it placed under pressure from a distance by a combination of pawns and pieces. One of the most powerful demonstrations of a center being laughed at and treated like a target is the Gruenfeld Defense. Though this new opening first attracted attention in 1922 when Gruenfeld beat Alekhine with it, it was actually first employed way, way back in 1855: J. Cochrane - Mahescandra, Calcutta 1855 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.e3 Bg7 5.Nf3 0-0 6.cxd5 Nxd5 7.Be2 Nxc3 8.hxc3 c5 9.0-0 cxd4 10.cxd4 Nc6 Diagram 325 White has a firm pawn center, but it's held at bay by black's pieces, which apply pressure from deep within their own camp. ll.Bb2 Bg4?!

Nevertheless, it's a pity nobody noticed 338 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N this game at that time-it might have completely changed the 19th century's landscape of chess thought. The Alekhine Defense (l .e4 Nf6) is another Hypermodern opening that was actually toyed with long before Hypermoderns existed! The oldest example I could find was from 1802 (!) in the game Madame de Remusat - Napoleon I, Paris (l .e4 Nf6 2.d3 Nc6 3.f4 e5 4.fxe5 Nxe5 5.Nc3 Nfg4 6.d4 Qh4+ 7.g3 Qf6 8.Nh3 Nf3 + 9.Ke2 Nxd4+ 10.Kd3 Ne5+ ll .Kxd4 Bc5+ 12 .Kxc5 Qb6+ 13 .Kd5 Qd6, mate). I don't know if Allgaier saw this game, but he analyzed l.e4 Nf6 in 1819 and decided that it was garbage. This opening wasn't given any respect until Alekhine used it twice in 1921 to score a win and a draw against Saemisch and Steiner-then it was off to the Hypermodern races with various adventur­ ous players goading white's center pawns forward in an attempt to smite them if they dared to go too far! N. Pegoraro - Henderson, Ischia 1996 l.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4 dxe5 6.fxe5 Nc6 7.Be3 Bf5 8.Nc3 e6 9.Nf3 Be7 10.d5 The older main line is 10.Be2 0-0 11 .0-0 f6 12.exf6 Bxf6 when black's piece­ pressure against the center creates a position with more or less equal chances for both sides.

Rxhl. 340 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Of course, over the years the strategy behind \"center bashing\" has deepened­ eventually it was understood that, aside from trying to shatter the center and feast on its tattered remains, one could also force the center to advance and make use of the newly weakened squares these advances often create. These same ideas can be used against all sorts of pawn centers, no matter what open­ ings they may arise from. However, let's return to the Gruenfeld Defense for a classic example of a center under siege. S. Gligoric - V. Smyslov, Kiev 1959 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7 7.Bc4 c5 8.Ne2 0-0 9.0-0 Nc6 10.Be3 Qc7 ll .Rcl Rd8 Diagram 328 Is white's space gaining center strong or weak? This position exudes a wonderful sense of balance and teamwork. White has a huge pawn center, but Black is taking aim at it with everything he can muster. Note that he's not just attacking randomly, he's doing his best to beat down d4. This is being carried out by black's dark-squared Bishop, his c-pawn, his Knight, and his d8-Rook-many pieces, one goal! On the other hand, White wants to make his center indestructible. If he can do that, then he can squeeze his opponent and eventually turn black's helpless­ ness into an attack on the wing, or a breakthrough down the middle. Thus, he is meeting black's aggression against d4 with his own tightening of that pawn-his c-pawn, dark-squared Bishop, Knight, and Queen are all holding life and limb together. 12.h3 The immediate 12.f4 can be met by 12 ...

White's kingside attack has been stifled and his zombie pieces are knocking against their own pawns on c3, d4, and f4 (the c2-Bishop is snuffed by the c4- and f5-pawns). Black, on the other hand, has a mobile queenside pawn majority, a light-squared Bishop that seems more laser beam than chess piece, and a Knight that can set up shop on d5. 19.g4 This loosens up the hl -a8 diagonal and thus puts his own King in jeopardy. However, it was either this attempt at kingside counterplay or passively waiting around to die. 19 ... Ne7 A good place for the Knight-it keeps an eye on his kingside pawn structure while threatening to leap to d5. 20.Kh2 Qc6 This move speaks for itself-the problem White faces along the hl-a8 diagonal takes on a concrete form. 21 .Ng3 b5 Note that Black isn't worried about 22.gxf5 exf5 , though this leaves White with two connected passed center pawns. Why wouldn't White be delighted with such a turn of events? The answer is that passed pawns aren't very useful if they can't be pushed, and in this position the d-pawn will be liquefied if it ever dares move to d5.

Instead, he should have put this move off for a moment in favor of 24 ... Ba8!

This time the center wins! R. Reti - Em. Lasker, New York 1924 l.Nf3 d5 2.c4 c6 3.b3 Bf5 4.g3 Nf6 5.Bg2 Nbd7 6.Bb2 e6 7.0-0 Bd6 8.d3 0-0 9.Nbd2 e5 10.cxd5 cxd5 ll.Rcl Diagram 331 Piece pressure vs. black's space gaining center Reti prepares his favorite setup: the Rook goes to c2 (making way for the Queen and preparing to double), his Queen to al (creating heat along the al-h8 diagonal), and Rfcl (taking the c-file). The \"attack the center from a distance\" strategy works in the Gruenfeld because Black has an open file that allows the Rooks to join directly in the center assault (see diagram 328). However, here that's not the case and quiet play can easily lead to a passive position for White since Black can effortlessly strengthen his center, leaving white's army vainly staring at a brick wall. 344 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Reti's setup is very picturesque, and one can understand his attachment to it, but Lasker shows that it just doesn't hold up against his old school methodol­ ogy. Thus, White needs to add a bit of spice to it via a well-timed e2-e4 strike. The question is, does this have to be employed now, or will it prove to be even better later (depending on black's reply to 11 .Rcl)? 11 .Rc 1 has been maligned by virtually every annotator-they insist that 1l .e4 was the way to go. Perhaps, but I'm not sold on the idea that 11 .Rcl is, by itself, bad. Before exploring the question of the worth of 11 .Rcl by continuing with the actual game, let's glance at 11 .e4, a move that declares immediate war on black's center. Black's possible replies: 11 ... dxe4 12 .Nxe4! (White doesn't get much from 12.dxe4 Be6 when 13 .Ng5 is met by 13 ... Bg4) 12 ... Bxe4 (12 ...

Though White is hitting black's center from a distance and also controls the c-file, all is not well in Boonsville. The problem is that his pawn-strikes against the center no longer work, and he can't up the pressure in any meaningful way. As for the c-file, all the penetration squares are well covered. This means that White has driven down a dead-end street. 15 ... Bh7 16.Nfl Nc5! 17.Rxc5 !? White, who realizes that he's been outplayed by Lasker and that things have turned sour, employs an Exchange sacrifice in order to imbalance the position and give himself something to crow about. Defensive moves such as 17.N3d2 and 17.Qa2 are met by 17 ... Na6 followed by 18 ... Nb4. 17 ... Bxc5 18.Nxe5 White's gotten a pawn for the Exchange, his dark-squared Bishop is slicing down the newly opened al-h8 diagonal, and black's once mighty center has been dismantled. However, black's position is solid, his pieces are well placed, both his Rooks will contribute down the c- and e-files, and he's material ahead. Thus, White doesn't have full compensation for the Exchange. 18 ... Rac8 18 ...

In fact, if it isn't dealt with properly, the side with less space can easily end up with a passive, cheerless position. � If you possess an advantage in space, don't forget about the other imbalances.

This seems obvious, but it's something that needs to be pondered and appreciated since many players forget that as pawns advance, the potential amount of squares they control diminishes. This means that as a player pushes his pawns and gains more and more space with them, he is also potentially leaving weakened squares in their wake. : ,<· :·<<,> Of course, pushing your pawns and creating squares that might prove weak later in the game is unavoidable. The key here is awareness-as long as you know the downside of every pawn advance, you'll be able to better judge whether or not such a square will really to be a problem as the game progresses. PART SEVEN I SPACE 349 � Aside from trying to shatter the center and feast on its tattered remains, one can also force the center to advance and make use of the newly weakened squares these advances often create. � In general, you don't want to wait around while the opponent's center grows more and more stable. You need to attack it with as much energy as possible. � \\Vhen facing a serious spatial disadvantage, you must demand counterplay by creating space in another sector of the board, finding a way to make soothing exchanges (which creates more room on your side of the board), proving that your opponent's spatial gains have left serious weaknesses in its wake, and/or by using pawn breaks to smash open lines and give your pieces the freedom to fight back! � In a closed position, pawn breaks are necessary to open lines for attack and to open files so the Rooks can join in the action. � In closed positions, the side with more pawn breaks is the side with the ability to call the shots. � Cat and Mouse is a strategy where your opponent is helpless. In such situations, barring a forced win, it's often good to \"Do in twenty what you could do in two.\" In other words, take your time and let your opponent enjoy the full bouquet of his position's misery. � If the center is closed, play has to be found on the wings. In such positions, you usually want to play on the side where you have more space (of course, there are exceptions-don't treat any rule as gospel). Once you determine which side that is, you will try and create weaknesses in the enemy camp, use pawn advances to gain even more territory in your chosen sector, and pawn breaks to crack open files for the Rooks so you can use them to penetrate into the hostile position. � In general, your space lies where your pawn chain points-to add to your space (and rip open files) in that area, you need to push the pawn that's next to your lead pawn. 350 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Space - Tests The section on space was enormous, which means there was a lot to absorb.

My reasons for doing so: --� A passed pawn can be a static powerhouse and/or a dynamic game winner. Thus understanding it will also improve your understanding of statics and dynamics. --� A passed pawn discourse is the ideal training ground for the concept of blockade. --� A pawn majority's ultimate goal is the creation of a passed pawn. Thus, understanding passed pawns vastly increases your understanding of pawn majorities. A passed pawn, even a protected passed pawn, can often turn out to be a serious disadvantage. This shocking fact alone warrants the creation of this section! Whether you refer to it as a \"passed pawn,\" a \"passer,\" a \"passed banana\" (a favorite among players in Denver), a \"baby Queen,\" a \"posing Polly\" (a passed pawn that just sits there, looking good but doing nothing), or (in the case of a fast-moving passed pawn) a \"nimble Louie,\" this particular kind of pawn has captured the imagination and respect of amateurs everywhere. A protected passed pawn is given even more reverence since nothing can hurt it, and at any moment it might rocket to the eighth rank (\"nimble Louie!\") and (if the pawn is owned by the opponent) turn into something unpleasant. In this chapter we're going to stare in awe at an unstoppable passer, while also demonstrating how nimble Louie's sprinting abilities can be forestalled by a blockade. Yes, a passed pawn can and often does invade the end zone and make a touchdown, but it can just as easily find itself glued to a square, unable to move or influence the game in any meaningful way. The material in this section will make your view of passed pawns more realistic, and give you the ability to decide when a passer is gold, and when it's nothing more than gaud. 356 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N Creation The most common way for a passed pawn to be \"born\" is via a pawn majority. Here's a clear example of a pawn majority's power: Diagram 341 White to move Black appears to be fine, but he's actually hopelessly lost! Why? Because White has a healthy kingside pawn majority while Black's queenside majority is crippled. Of course, that alone won't be decisive since black's Queen is very actively placed. However, White realizes that he can force the trade of all black's pieces, leaving him with a dead won King and pawn endgame. l.Rxf7 Rxf7 l.. .Qd4+ 2.R7f2 leaves White with an extra Rook. 2.Rxf7 Kxf7 3.Qc4+!

Then his King will have to leave h4, thereby allowing white's majority to start its march after Kg3 , h3 -h4, etc. 10 ... g6 11 .Kg2 Kg5 11 ... g5 leads to the same kind of end as that in the note to black's 9th move. 12.Kg3 Kf6 13 .h4 Kg7 14.Kf4 Kf6 15.h5 We finally see the birth of a passed pawn! 15 ... g5+ It's more or less the same thing after 15 ... gxh5 16.gxh5 Kg7 17.Kg5. 16.Ke4 Ke6 17.h6 Kf6 18.h7 Kg7 19.Kf5 Kxh7 20.Kxg5 Kg7 21.Kf5 Kf7 22.g5 Kg7 23 .g6 White could also win by Ke6 when all of black's queenside pawns will be devoured. 23 ...

It's clear that a pawn majority can be a huge static plus since it can sit quietly for ages, apparently doing nothing. Then, in the blink of an eye, it can rush forward and give birth to a Queen. However, a pawn majority can also be a dynamic powerhouse, mixing the creation of a passed pawn with some seriously nasty space gaining boa action. B. Spassky - L.

Three Kinds of Useless Passed Pawns Though possession of a passed pawn can offer a static promise of endgame \"insurance\" or a dynamic bonus if it starts rolling down the board, at other times a passed pawn can be completely useless. There are three kinds of useless passed pawns: --..... There is a life and death struggle going on and the pawn has absolutely nothing to do with it. Successful blockade relegates it to useless status. __ ..... It turns out to be more weakness than strength. 368 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION This means that you shouldn't fall in love with a passed pawn without looking at the board and carefully judging its place in the ultimate scheme of things.

Not only that, but the passed g-pawn is also attacking white's Rook and threatens to turn into a Queen. However, all that melodrama is meaningless here, as are both of black's kingside pawns. The only things that matter in this position are development and King safety. Sadly for Black, he's on the loser's end of both. 13 .Bfi+ Ke7 14.Rgl Nh4 One can understand black's feelings-this move protects his Knight and also defends his beloved g-passer! 15.Bxh5 Bg7 16.Qg4 Bxd4 Black is still dreaming of promoting his g-pawn by ...

His pieces are more active than black's and his pawns are healthier and far more dynamic. In fact, an eventual f4-f5 push will not only allow White to strive for a far advanced passed pawn by e5-e6, but it will also create serious kingside angst by the threat of f5-f6. 18 ... f5! Black, by force, turns white's central pawn majority into a protected passed e-pawn. But wasn't it the dream of the pawn majority to become a passed pawn? Therefore, does black's 18 ... f5 make any sense at all? Actually, it does! By giving White a protected passed pawn, he ends all the dynamic potential of white's former pawn majority. Gone is the space guzzling threat of f4-f5, gone is the kingside smash of an eventual f4-f5-f6. All that remains is white's passed e-pawn. This leaves us with one final question: The e5 -pawn is a protected passer, so where's the downside? Yes, we're still not clear on whether it will be a \"Nimble Louie\" or a \"Posing Polly\", but at the very least it should offer White useful endgame insurance. Or, is there something in this verbal analysis that's missing? I'll answer this in the note to black's 19th move. 19.Ng3 19.Ng5 h6 20.Qh5 Nxf4 21 .Rxf4 hxg5 wouldn't make White happy, but what about 19.Nc5, which threatens 20.Nxb7! Bxb7 21 .Qb3+?

Be6 PHILOSOPHY Useless Pawn Two: Blockade can turn a passed pawn into a traitor! :� 370 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Diagram 357 It's official: the e5-pawn is a Posing Polly! But isn't it still useful as endgame insurance? In fact, black's doubled majority has to be inferior to the mighty passed pawn! Right? Nope. There are three reasons for this: --... The e5-pawn is acting as a traitor to white's army! That's right, a traitor! First off, it blocks the d4-Bishop. Second, it stops up the e5 -square (which white's Bishop and Knight might like to use if it was open). Finally, it blocks the e-file which, in turn, lets Black comfortably stick a minor piece on e6 (White Rooks doubled on the e-file would pressure a piece there, but now e6 is rock solid). __ ... Black's queenside majority, though devalued due to the doubled c-pawns, is still mobile and active (after an eventual ... b6 followed by ... c5 they will control key squares and gain queenside space). On the other hand, white's e-pawn has no dynamic plusses at all. __ ... We still have to address where each side will play on. Black's queenside majority (after ... b6 and ... c5) will give him a comfortable game on the queenside. The center, with the exception of the d-file which both sides can make use of, is blocked. The kingside offers White nothing at all. Once you take all this in, you will come to realize that White has no real advantage. 20.b3 Rad8 21 .c4 This prevents ...

Couple that with the Bishops of opposite colors and there's no reason either side should continue the game. Let's take an exaggerated look at the concept of a protected passed pawn being a traitor: Diagram 358 White to move White's protected passed pawn is frozen in place by the fine blockading black Knight. What else does White have to crow about? Nothing-the queenside and kingside are locked up and the only open file is, at the moment, controlled by Black. Thus, White doesn't have anything in this position. However, if we were to remove the traitorous e5 -pawn (just take it off and toss it into the box!) then White wins immediately since all his pieces spring to life: his tripled heavy pieces nuke the e-file, his Bishop ravages the al-h8 diagonal, and his Knight can leap into e5 if the situation demands it. Sadly for White, the e5 -pawn must remain on the board (I suppose you could offer the pawn to your opponent: \"I'll give you my e-pawn. Seriously! I'll just take it off the board and hand it to you!\"), which means that all of white's pieces are misplaced due to their hitting the e5 -brick. 372 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Since Black intends to double up on the d-file, White would be advised to initiate some exchanges and agree to a quick draw after l.Rdl Rxdl 2.Qxdl Rd8 3.Rd3 Rxd3 4.Qxd3 Qd8, =.

Why is that the case? Because the e4-pawn will be under permanent pressure, white's d-pawn isn't going anywhere and is now an official traitor, and black's passed c-pawn (once it gets going) will cause White some serious problems. Note that the Knight also controls the blockading square in front of its c-pawn, meaning that it will be hard for White to stop it once the thing decides to begin its march down the board.

Blockade-Caveat (Obicem) Emptor At this point the hard working student, having read and mastered the material about blockading passed pawns, will studiously follow my advice, triumphantly planting a Knight in front of the enemy passer and celebrating that this unchal­ lengeable blockade will ensure him excellent chances. Then, when he realizes that his position doesn't seem to offer him anything to do, he'll passively sit 382 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION (cursing my name with every tick of the chess clock) and watch as his Silman­ based edifice gets crushed like an eggshell. Ah, the questions that would follow! \"How could this happen?\" \"Was Silman lying to us all?\" \"Does Silman even know how to play chess?\" Calm down!

PA RT EIGHT I PA SSED PAWNS 385 Summary � A passed pawn can be a static powerhouse and/or a dynamic game winner. Thus understanding it will also improve your understanding of statics and dynamics. � A passed pawn discourse is the ideal training ground for the concept of blockade. � A pawn majority's ultimate goal is the creation of a passed pawn-understanding passed pawns vastly increases your understanding of pawn majorities. � A passed pawn, even a protected passed pawn, can often turn out to be a serious disadvantage. � A passed pawn usually shines brightest in King and pawn endgames and Queen endgames since, in this case, the lone enemy Queen can't maintain a blockade on its own. � The ideal plan for a player with an advanced passed pawn is to exchange all the minor pieces, leaving both sides with a Queen and Rook(s) vs. Queen and Rook(s). This makes the blockade of the passer uncomfortable since Queens and Rooks are not ideal blockaders. Note that the Queens should usually be retained since that piece's power makes the defending King's participation in the defense rather risky. � There are three kinds of useless passed pawns: 0 There is a life and death struggle going on and the pawn has absolutely nothing to do with it. 0 A successful blockade relegates it to useless status. 0 It turns out to be more weakness than strength. � When a passed pawn exists on the board, a blockade of the pawn is often of critical importance for both sides. Will the defender manage to create a successful blockade? Will the side with the passer managed to prevent it?

By far, the most common question I'm asked is, \"What openings are best for me and how do I create a proper opening repertoire?\" Of course, I warn them about the \"spending all your study time memorizing variations rather than learn­ ing how to play good chess\" syndrome, but then I cave to their query and point out the following critical points which have to be addressed when choosing an opening system that's right for a particular individual: Choose openings that suit your style/temperament-just because the world's best players use it doesn't mean that it's right for you! Choose openings that suit both your schedule and memory-if you decide on a mainline Najdorf for Black (l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6), make sure you have the vast amount of time it takes to look at the endless stream of variations, and make sure you have the ability to memorize all that information. There are many openings that demand far less \"theoretical housekeeping\" and are far more forgiving of those whose memories have seen better days. ••...,. Choose openings that cater to your chess strengths-i.e., if you play closed positions really well, go for systems that tend to lock up the center. If you are a strong positional player but can't always \"keep up\" in sharp tactical situations, pick lines that avoid chaos. If tactics is what you're all about, make sure your opening choices are conducive to that particular talent. Choose openings that make you happy-this might sound a tad strange, but if the positions you achieve from your openings don't make you feel excited, happy, or at the very least, deeply satisfied, then why in the world are you using those systems? Don't choose openings based on the opinion of others, on chess squiggles like += and =, or on computer assessments. Even if a position is thought to be mildly better for the other 392 HO W TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION side, that doesn't mean it's not fully playable-often a player's affinity for a particular position is far more important than its reputation. Basically, if you like it, then play it. Now, let's come to a FULL STOP! The above information is for players who want their openings to highlight their existing strengths and, as a result, give them immediate positive results. However, if you are more interested in improving your overall understanding (rather than just gaining a few rating points due to the help of a complementary opening repertoire), then a very different opening philosophy can be implemented: Choose openings that don 't suit your style/temperament! Choose openings that cater to your chess weaknesses! Choose openings that freak you out and leave you feeling vulnerable and insecure! In other words, this system of thought recommends openings that force you to come face to face with your chess failings so you can patch them up! Thus, if you're starting out and don't feel comfortable attacking the opponent's King, take up crazy gambits that lead to wide open positions and sharp tactics (1 .e4 eS 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 is one example). If you are an experienced player (perhaps 1400 - 1900) who has earned his successes by playing solid openings but who fears sharper positions, switch to 1.e4 and dive head first into more fluid situations. If you are a pretty good attacker but hide from positional chess, which you view as dull or alien, throw away your beloved 1.e4 and switch to l.d4 or even l.c4 and see how the other half lives. Grandmaster Nick de Firm­ ian, an internationally feared attacking player, did this when he realized that his positional understanding wasn't on the same (extremely high) level as his dynamic skills. He took up 1.d4 for a year and, once he gained the necessary lessons, went back to 1.e4 wiser and stronger than ever. Be warned! This \"bizarro\" repertoire is only for brave souls who are extremely dedicated to improving every facet of their game, no matter how much pain and humiliation it takes for them to achieve it (and there will be pain and humili­ ation since you'll suffer many losses as you slowly but surely raise the level of your chess IQ). Of course, all this (via either philosophical repertoire system) is just the start of creating a very personal, very effective opening repertoire. For example, learning all the basic plans and tactics that usually arise from your openings is also a must. However, even with the addition of the plans and tactics, both philosophical repertoire systems are still missing one final piece of the opening puzzle: Whether your opening is dynamic, static, dosed, or open, you need to fully understand the interplay of imbalances that your opening offers. j PART NINE I OTHER IMB ALANCES 393 !!!����}1!£lmbalance,s YY!!h !���\" Opening Choi�� Integrating your understanding of imbalances (and, since you've gotten this far in the book, I expect you to have a very healthy grasp of this subject!) into your openings is a virtual must, since most of the time the lines you've memorized will be avoided by opponents who don't know what's going on, and/or don't know what the right moves are. This isn't a big deal for a player who understands the soul of his opening, since he'll immediately realize if his opponent's non-book move does or does not make sense, and what has to be done to punish it or, if the move is fine but new, how to handle the position in a logical manner. Players who only know a bunch of moves won't be able to do this. One example is the Accelerated Dragon, Maroczy Bind: l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Diagram 383 Black to move As Black, you need to know white's intentions and your general plans, setups, the kinds of endgames that you do and don't want, and the usual imbalances all these things will offer you. Since this isn't an opening book, we'll keep it very simple. Maroczy Basics: White's 5 .c4 gains central and queenside space, making black's usual pawn­ break ideas ( ... b7-b5 and ... d7-d5) very difficult to achieve. White gets a firm grip on d5 and will usually place a Knight there-if Black plays ... e7 -e6, he deprives white's army use of d5 but also leaves the d7 -pawn and the d6-square potentially weak. At times White can simply hunker down with b2-b3 and f2 -f3 and hope that his space advantage will suffocate Black. White can also advance his queenside pawns, hoping to overrun that wing, or play f2-f4-f5 and build up a kingside attack. 394 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION It's clear that passive play won't hold up in the face of white's space advantage. But what can Black do? There are several plans: Black can set up shop on the dark squares. There are a few ways to do this, but the most common is to swap the c6-Knight for white's horse on d4, and eventually trade the dark squared Bishops. Then squares such as a5 and/or b4 become livable for black's Queen, and c5 or d4 can be grabbed by black's remaining Knight. Black can swap off as many minor pieces as possible and leave himself (ideally) with a powerful Knight (on c5 or d4) versus a bad light-square Bishop. This often leads to a favorable endgame for Black. Black can play for the ... b7-b5 pawn break, fighting for queenside domination. Black can play for the ... d7-d5 pawn break, ripping open the center. I said that 5 .c4 made these pawn breaks difficult for Black to achieve, but not impossible! So we've determined that the main imbalances in the Maroczy are space (which brings about pawn breaks, designed to combat white's spatial advantage), possible minor piece plusses, and square control. There's a lot more, of course, but this little bit of knowledge will make an Accelerated Dragon fan's life much easier. Let's look at a couple of these ideas in action. First up, the ... d5 break: J.

Let me repeat: these plans aren't based on emotion or wish fulfillment-they are based on a clear appreciation of the imbalances. Speaking of wish fulfillment, let's take a look at what can happen when a player decides to do something that suits his style, but doesn't suit the position! Long ago (in 1834), there were two players (De la Bourdonnais and Mc­ Donnell) who ruled the chess landscape with an iron grip. As is often the case, the public wanted to see these chess titans go at each other in a match, and that wish led to a protracted struggle of no less than 85 games, which were played over six matches in the same year! When the smoke cleared, De la Bourdonnais had won a decisive victory which proved that he was-without any doubt-the best player of his day. One reason for this match win was that De la Bourdonnais (described by an English observer of the time as, \"a large, slovenly Frenchman who spent most of his time spitting and cursing, and at other times singing and laughing.\") played every phase of the game well, while McDonnell (an Irishman who was \"quiet and reserved\") was pretty much a seek and destroy kind of guy. At the highest levels of any sport, a lack of bal­ ance is usually an insurmountable failing, and this match was just another example of that rule in action. In several games, McDonnell (as Black) played a solid positional reply to l.d4 (l .d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4) but then-deciding that he could make the opening choice suit his style rather than making moves that were conducive to the opening choice-he lashed out with the hyper-aggressive but ill-advised . . . f7 -f5 (as early as move 3 and also later), hoping to heat things up. As a result, he was repeatedly slaughtered in various gory ways. PART NINE I OTHER IM BALANCES 399 De Ia Bourdonnais - A. McDonnell, Match 1 Game 8, 1834 l.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.Nc3 f5? Diagram 389 Just three moves into the opening and we already get the impression that some­ thing odd has occurred. While black's first two moves create the time-honored Queen's Gambit Accepted, his third (a suggestion of Philidor!) is something that rarely (probably never!) appears on a modern chessboard. This leaves us with an obvious question: Is 3 .. .f5 bad, and if so, why? Surely a chess legend like Philidor and an attacking powerhouse like McDonnell saw a lot of good in 3 .. .f5. Can you spot the positive features of black's third move? The main point of 3 ... fS is to fight for control over the important e4-square. Black envisions that, after a further ... Nf6, ... e6, and ... c6, he'll have a firm grip on e4 and, as a result of having stopped White from expanding in the center with e2-e4, he'll also have an unassailable hold on d5. These are noble positional dreams for a guy whose late-night ruminations were usually filled with enemy Kings running for their lives! However, dreams are one thing and reality is quite another-in this case black's aggressive grab at e4 does more harm than good: ... f5 (a dynamic try for static gold) weakens both e5 and e6, loosens up his King, blocks the c8-Bishop, and weakens the a2-g8 diagonal. In a way, McDonnell's love affair with ... f5 demonstrates both his strength and his main weakness as a player: acting the role of bully and trying to make everyone believe your flawed vision works against inferior opposition, but when the opponent can see beyond the glitz and show how a move like ... fS is rotting away the very foundation of your position, it's time to back off and try something less weakening. As we will see, McDonnell refused to accept the truth, and so his stubbornness led to him being pummeled time and again for the same mistake! This reminds me of amateurs who fall in love with gambits like l.e4 c5 2.b4 or l.e4 e5 2 .Nf3 d5. They can be very effective against their inferiors and even their peers, so by all means play them if you enjoy this kind of game. But don't 400 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION embrace delusion and claim that they are good-they most certainly are not! Give it a go if you must, but once someone finally prepares for you in a proper manner and pushes you off the board, accept the writing on the wall and toss the whole mess into the garbage bin. 4.e3 White, who is well aware of the shortcomings of black's 3...f5 idea, realizes that crazy adventures are not called for since he's not developed (don't attack if your pieces aren't ready for action). Thus, he intends to do the following: __ ..... Develop. ••...,.. Win the c4-pawn before Black tries to defend it via ... c6 followed by ... b5. Dominate the weakened light-squares on the a2 -g8 diagonal. 4 ... e6 Black closes the a2-g8 diagonal (knowing White will capture on c4), gives added support to the d5-square, and frees his f8-Bishop. So far, everything is going according to black's plan. 5.Bxc4 It's hard to resist a move that develops, eats a pawn and takes control over a severely weakened diagonal! 5 ... c6 Still plodding along with his plan of gaining control over the e4- and d5- squares. 6.Nf3 White wants to get more pieces out before he goes into kill-mode. This move develops, eyes the hole on e5, allows for N g5 in many variations (targeting e6), and also prepares to castle. Notice how white's moves have been simple, safe, and natural, yet his opponent's position has deteriorated after each one. This is due to the fact that black's 3...f5 created long-term weaknesses that won't be going away any time soon. In other words, if Black manages to hang on in the opening, White will make use of black's structural weaknesses in the middlegame and torture him for a long time to come. And if White sees a chance to nuke his opponent, he'll happily take it. 6 ... Bd6 7.e4 White, who enjoys a significant lead in development, shows a good sense of timing! Since his King can now castle at the drop of a hat, and since black's King will remain in the center for the foreseeable future, de la Bourdonnais has every PART NINE I OTHER IMBALANCES 401 right to crack open the center because 0-0 followed by Re 1 will quickly follow, while Qb3 is also lurking in the shadows. 7 ... b5 8.Bb3 a5?

Nevertheless, though the opening was going through a mutual refinement phase by both players in the next three games (the lOth, 12th, and 15th of Match One), the result was the same: White won them all. McDonnell's handling of the system was getting better and better, but his 0-4 score in the QGA duel had to be hard to swallow.

This series of games is the finest example I've ever come across of a gifted attacking player trying, over and over, to create a kingside attack in an open­ ing that simply didn't offer that option! All Black ended up doing was creating self-inflicted weaknesses and, ultimately, finding that his own King was the one getting mated! The message here should be crystal clear: if you must attack, play an opening that gives you a chance to make it a reality. However, even the greatest of attack­ ers can't always get positions that allow them to do their thing. Thus, strive to create some balance in your skill-set. Attack is great, but at least be competent at using the imbalances to surround a weakened pawn, take advantage of weak squares, and all the other wonderful positional things you can do if the situa­ tion calls for it.

Of course, that's good news PART NINE I OTHER IM BALANCES 407 for Shirov, who is one of the finest attacking players on Earth. However, White would have to go for the kingside attack even if he was the ultra positional Ulf Andersson. At the risk of repeating myself for the thousandth time, you have to do what the position wants you to do! Of course, Shirov deliberately played this opening variation in the hope of reaching this kind of position-a position that suits his style very well. Why does White have to attack here? He stands worse on the queenside and the center is more or less locked. That only leaves the kingside, so playing there is a no-brainer. Of course, other \"small details\" like the e5-pawn influencing the kingside and the open g-file (a road to black's King) only strengthens one's resolve to throw everything you have at the enemy monarch. 19.Bc2 An easy move to make-black's Knight is far away from its beleaguered King while white's light-squared Bishop can join in the kingside festivities from a distance. Thus, why allow Black to swap and deprive the white army of a new recruit? 19 ...

White played for an attacking position (the kind of position that best suited his style) right from the opening, he achieved it, and then he devoted all his energy into making the attack crash through. This blend of opening choice and style, and then opening to middlegame (and, if necessary, to endgame) follow-through (all in perfect balance with your chess strengths and tastes), is extremely important if you want to milk every drop from the openings you employ. Here's a quick example of such a situation from the positional player's point of view (we seem to have had a tad too many attacks in the preceding examples!). In this game White plays a line that's designed to give him a tiny positional edge based on more space and a queenside pawn majority. White deliberately entered it in the opening (and Black also deliberately allowed it, expecting to draw), turned the slight plus into something more substantial in the Queenless middlegame, and then turned these \"tiny\" things into victory in the endgame.

So far, most of the games have been rather one-sided. At a high level, it's far more common to see one side fight to prove the supremacy of his positive imbalances while the other side does everything possible to prove his own case. 410 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION M.

But if you take a look at the imbalances, you might begin to come to a different conclusion: 412 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION --� White's doubled queenside pawns leave him half a pawn down (at least until he un-doubles them with b3 -b4-b5). --� White's Rooks look great, but they are stuck on the d-file (if the dl -Rook leaves that file, then the d5-Rook will hang, while if the d5-Rook moves, it might allow Black to get his central pawns in motion by ... d6-d5). This means that the c-file is up for grabs, and once a black Rook claims it an incursion to the 7th rank should pay dividends. --� White's Knight is a monster as long as the d-pawn can't advance. But can white's Rooks stay in their present position forever? If not, that d-pawn will move, and that means the once god-like horse will suddenly become inferior to black's Bishop. Black's position is already a bit more comfortable, though White should certainly hold the draw. 24.b4 ReS 25.b5 Taking a moment off to keep black's Rook out of c2 doesn't have the desired effect: 25.Rld2 Rcl+ 26.Kf2 Rc4 (threatening both ...

REMEMBER An opening battle between two theoretically astute players ultimately boils down to a philosophical difference of opinion. But if you don't know the philosophy (imbalances & general ideas) behind your opening lines, then all you're left with is random moves. PART NINE I OTHER IM BALANCES 413 Let's explore this idea of a philosophical battle in a bit more detail: V. lvanchuk - T. Radjabov, Wijk aan Zee 2009 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.Nf3 e5 7.0-0 Nc6 8.d5 Ne7 9.b4 Ne8 10.a4 f5 ll.a5 Diagram 402 And here grandmaster Radjabov gave us one sentence (from New In Chess 2, 2009) that is both simple and profound: \"White has gained a lot of space on the queenside, but Black has a lot of play on the kingside.\" That's it! This is what everyone needs to be able to do with any and every opening he plays-you need to know what your opening is giving to you, and what it's giving to your opponent. This kind of thing seems self-evident, but if, after the first 15 moves of your favorite opening, I was to pull you aside and ask you to explain exactly what this line is offering you and what it's offering your opponent, would you be able to instantly lecture me on its basic building blocks? Can you do this with every opening you play? Most players can't, and this is a tragedy since it's so very simple to arm yourself with this oh-so-critical information. In most cases, these philosophical opening arguments are never resolved if the openings are sound main line systems-both sides have their chances and the player who understands the position better, had a good-biorhythm day, or is simply stronger, usually does quite well. In the case of inferior or experimental openings, there might very well be a resolution with one side permanently being branded as inferior. Here's an example of a well-intentioned positional try for Black achieving good results until a certain something appeared to destroy his fun. M. Okkes - J. Bosch, Holland 2003 l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 a6 The O'Kelly Variation.

Andonov, French Team Championship 2009_ Most players want an opening repertoire that suits their tastes/style and will hold up as the flow of fashion comes and goes. None of the mainstream openings (Caro-Kann, French Defense, l.e4 e5, Sicilian, Gruenfeld Defense, King's Indian, Queen's Gambit, English Opening, etc.) will ever be refuted, so if you want to stick with something over a long period of time, go with the oldies but goodies and try and avoid strange gambits or a \"too good to be true\" flavor of the month. Staying with something allows you to create an intimate knowledge of all its secrets, and you'll find that it will serve you well for a lifetime. Usually you will find yourself in an opening of your choosing (something you've prepared beforehand-though whether that preparation is deep or shal­ low is up to your strength, experience, and/or work ethic), which means you should already know (to some extent) the main imbalances, ideas, and plans. On the other hand, your opponent might surprise you (for example, with l.b4 or, as Black, something like l.e4 e5 2 .NB d5) and drag you into something you're clueless about. In the first case (i.e., you get an opening you're familiar with), you should do fine since, even if your opponent leaves known theory at some point, you'll be able to make moves that are sensible and good (fully in accordance with the imbalances) for the upcoming middlegame. Things get a bit more taxing if you end up in undiscovered country, though if it's some positional line then you should get by fine by simply returning to your \"imbalance roots.\" For example, after l.b4 you realize that White is gaining queenside space and also intends Bb2 . Pretty simple! You can say, \"Okay, he took queenside space so I'll take something too-how about central space?\" And so l. .. e5 makes perfect sense. Then you would continue going for the center (and striving to make your cen­ ter indestructible) while he would attack your center from the side and try to continue making queenside gains. You wouldn't know any theory about l.b4, but your approach would ensure a balanced fight. Harder to deal with is some tactical surprise in the opening. In this case, rational thought (imbalances) might have to take a back seat to raw calculation. However, just because your opponent tries to drag you down the rabbit hole doesn't mean you have to go! The following shows just such a situation. PART NINE I OTHER IMB ALANCES 417 J. Silman - T. Hanks, National Open 1998 l.d4 g6 2.e4 Bg7 3.Nf3 c6 4.Nc3 d5 5.h3 Nf6 6.e5 Ne4 Diagram 405 Annoying! I was dimly aware of some analysis covering 7.Nxe4 (which is the only way to actually try and refute 6 ... Ne4) 7 ... dxe4 8.Ng5 c5, but I didn't re­ member any of the details. My opponent had made his first six moves instantly and seemed quite pleased with himself-it was clear that he knew exactly what would be going on after the capture on e4! Though I had no problem fighting players on the stage of their choosing, it had to be \"fair\" in that I felt I could outplay anyone in a positional fight (as long as we can let those imbalances lead us to the Promised Land, all should be well), while I also was confident of being able to find the right tactics against some garbage opening that begged to be tactically refuted. But this 6 ... Ne4 was different-the complications were far from clear, and if he was booked to the hilt then I would be a fool to walk into his preparations (in effect, instead of playing Mr. Hanks, I would be playing a team of grandmaster analysts). So, considering all this, my decision was easy to understand: 7.Bd3 Avoiding his tactical preparations and forcing a difficult strategic battle. Now the winner will be the player with the most skills, not the player with the best memory! The philosophy of stepping away from sharp opening surprises with a calming move that keeps the position sane and \"imbalance friendly\" has served me well on many occasions, and I recommend you make use of it to! 7 ... Nxc3 8.bxc3 c5 9.0-0 with a slight pull for White. Though my \"don't needlessly leap into the rabbit hole\" philosophy showed its worth over the course of my career, there were times when my opponent's \"transgression\" was so great that I couldn't back down. Here's a case in point: 418 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION J. Silman - D. Root, Berkeley 1981 l.d4 dS 2.c4 eS Just two moves, and Black has managed to push his d- and e-pawns to their 4th rank Here, answering 2 ... e5 with a quiet move (3 .Nc3, 3.e3 , etc.) just won't cut it since black's pawn center and easy development assures him a good game. Would you let Black, after just two moves, get away with this affront to all that's sane and right? No! Black has demanded too much too fast, and a guy has to draw a line in the sand at some point! 3.dxe5 I didn't know much Albin Counter Gambit theory (I spent my study time on more mainstream openings), but the die had been cast and I accepted that my dream of a quiet positional struggle wasn't going to come true. Now my mood swung to one of do or die-he would follow with the space-gaining ... d4 and then try and build up an attacking position, and I would welcome the fight by mixing energetic development with raw, overwhelming greed. 3 ... d4 4.Nf3 Nc6 S.g3 Bg4 6.Bg2 Qd7 7.0-0 h5 8.Qb3 Nge7 9.Bg5 h4 Diagram 406 Black's attacking like a madman, but isn't he offering me a second pawn?

Rg8 16.Ne4 Qxg7 17.h4 A case of too many good choices. 17 .Bf6 was probably best, while 17 .Nf6 Rxg5 18.Nxg8 was also strong, though a tad complicated. But why risk anything?

However, when your opponent butts heads and insists on start­ ing an immediate (but theoretically dubious) knife fight, you often have to get down and dirty and leap into the fray, even if you're not conversant with theory. 420 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Summary ======:>- The imbalances are a critical tool for a proper understanding of any and all opening systems. ======:>- Choose openings that suit your style/temperament-just because the world's best players use it doesn't mean that it's right for you! ======:>- Choose openings that suit both your schedule and memory. ======:>- Choose openings that cater to your chess strengths-i.e., if you play closed positions really well, go for systems that tend to lock up the center. If you are a strong positional player but can't always \"keep up\" in sharp tactical situations, pick lines that avoid chaos. If tactics is what you're all about, make sure your opening choices are conducive to that particular talent. ======:>- Choose openings that make you happy-this might sound a tad strange, but if the positions you achieve from your openings don't make you feel excited, happy, or at the very least, deeply satisfied, then why in the world are you using those systems? ======:>- Don't choose openings based on the opinion of others, on chess squiggles like += and =, or on computer assessments. Even if a position is thought to be mildly better for the other side, that doesn't mean it's not fully playable. Often a player's affinity for a particular position is far more important than its reputation. Basically, if you like it, then play it. ======:>- If you wish to create a temporary \"learning\" repertoire based on facing and fixing your weaknesses, then you can consider these three things: 0 Choose openings that don't suit your style/temperament! 0 Choose openings that cater to your chess weaknesses! 0 Choose openings that freak you out and leave you feeling vulnerable and insecure! ======:>- Whether your opening is dynamic or static, closed or open, you need to fully understand the interplay of imbalances that your opening offers. ======:>- An opening battle between two theoretically astute players ultimately boils down to a philosophical difference of opinion. But if you don't know the philosophy (imbalances and general PART NINE I OTHER IMB ALANCES 421 ideas) behind your opening lines, then all you're left with is random moves. You always need to know what your opening is giving to you, and what it's giving to your opponent. Imbalances in the Opening - Tests I'm going to do something different in this group of problems. If a problem presupposes that the position arrives from an opening you know, I'll list the basic imbalance schema (to create an artificial \"I know what's going on here!\" mindset) and then pose a specific question. If a problem presupposes that the position arrives from an opening you know nothing about, I'll simply give you a specific question.

Part Two I Minor Pieces - Knights ANSWER PART TWO TEST 1 Diagram 39 [Level: 1200 - 1600] White to move This position is from a \"postal\" game on Chessworld.net between 0404it (2 1 50) and RR (unrated), 2008. Both players could use more exciting names, but the posi­ tion they reached is quite an instructive one. White has more space in every sector of the board. White has two active Bishops. White has an attack against the enemy King. White controls the center. White has the better pawn structure (e6 is weak). Black's Knights play a purely defensive role. These facts tell us that White enjoys an overwhelming position. Explaining the Rating Spread: The answer is very straightforward and not only entombs the Knight, but also attacks the King. A 1200 might miss the entombed horse, but going after black's King with g6 would certainly prove attractive. Mr. 0404it finishes the game in exemplary fashion: l.g6! White had the choice of several good moves, but this makes (by far!) the nicest impression. If you played this to specifically entomb black's h8-Knight, then give yourself a pat on the back! l.. .h6 Playing such a move must feel similar to slicing one's own wrists with a dull blade. However, Black couldn't have been very excited by lines like 1 ... Bf6 (1 ...

Mter 1 ... h6 we have the honor of being witness to a classic Knight entombment and the coining of a new chess term. From this moment on, an entombed horse on hi, al, a8, or h8 will be known as a Vestigial Knight-it looks like a Knight, it smells like a Knight, but it doesn't move or twitch (even if you poke it) or serve any real function. In effect this means that White is a piece up and can win a middlegame (since he has a larger army to make use of) or an endgame with ease. 2.Nel! A lovely move that shows white's class. Seeing that Black is completely helpless, White realizes he's in no hurry to lower the boom and first seeks to improve the position of his lamest piece-the c2-Knight. The concept of calmly bringing all your pieces to their best squares is a very important one, and is often overlooked by the amateur. The following quote by Grandmaster Jesse Kraai (during a lecture in 2008) pushes the point home: \"Bad players like to play with their 'pretty' pieces. It is the mark of good players that they won't go on an adventure before they solve the problem of their bad pieces.\" 2 .. .

And doesn't Black also have the worse pawn structure (three pawn islands to two)? These pro-white ruminations might appear reasonable, except that they fail to take into account black's pluses and the dynamic possibilities available to him. For instance, Black is placing serious pressure on the f4-pawn and, if either Rook were forced to move away from the pawn's defense, Black would win a pawn and most likely the game with it. Also note that one of black's \"despised\" extra pawn islands is comprised of powerful center pawns, which gain space and take squares and files away from the enemy pieces. Finally, white's Knight isn't doing anything. It can't safely move forward and it won't be a world-beater if it moves backwards either. Since white's f-pawn is under pressure, the first thing Black needs to do is ask if he can increase that pressure or chase one of the defenders away. Since going after f4 right away via ... e5 or ... g5 fails to achieve anything of significance (White would capture either pawn), that leaves us looking at the other idea of harassing a defender. At the moment, the f3-Rook is solidly guarded and can't be successfully attacked. The d4-Rook is another matter; it's obvious that the light b7-Bishop can't influence the d4-square, but what about black's Knight? And once you pose that simple question, the correct move is suddenly easy to find. _Explaining the Rating Spread: There seems to be a lot going on, so a Knight retreat to b8 most likely wouldn't occur to anyone under 1800, and could be easily missed by much higher rated players. Nevertheless, I would expect those in the 1800 - 2000 range who have read the earlier material on Knights to come up with the solution. 22 ... Nb8! Winning material by force! Who would have guessed that a Knight retreat would have been so powerful? 23.Kgl The only way to defend the f4-pawn is 23.g3 , but that fails badly: 23 ... e5 24.Rd1 d4 25.Nb 1 g5 and white's position has been run over.

White has a lead in development, he has more space, he threatens to capture the pawn on c6, and he even has the superior pawn structure! In fact, other than his two rather inactive Bishops, it's hard to see what Black has to crow about. I featured this position in a lecture I gave that had about 200 spectators (the ratings ranged from beginner to 2200+). I asked the crowd who was better here. The vast majority felt that White had a considerable advantage, while none of the 200 thought that Black had more than equality. Explaining the Rating Spread: A tough one! I wouldn't be surprised to see some masters missing it. Somehow, it's anti-intuitive to give up the coveted two Bishops and to hand White a protected passed pawn to boot! Nevertheless, as you grow to appreciate a Knight's blockading powers, you will begin to actively strive to create such situations. l.. .Bxe5! Wonderful! Black happily gives away his two Bishops in order to hand White a protected passed pawn! This is either very deep, or very stupid. However, since I gave it an exclamation point, you should probably vote for the former. Note that 1 ... Qe8, retaining the two Bishops while also defending c6, is a mistake since 2.Nac4 grants White the advantage for all the reasons mentioned earlier. After 2 ... Be7, one problem Black will face is his weakness down the e-file, which White can highlight by the simple 3.Re2 followed by Rae l (3 .Nf3 is also excellent). 2.dxe5 Unfortunately, 2.fxe5 fails to 2 ... f4 3.Bf2 f3 when Black has a strong attack. 2 ... c5 A very logical move that both denies White use of the d4-square and prepares to place the c8-Bishop on b7 where it will laser its way through white's position. An interesting alternative is 2 ... g5, trying to blast open the g-file or, ifWhite takes on g5, hoping to push the f-pawn down white's throat. This demented looking move is fully playable, but Black doesn't need to be in any hurry. He can always come back to this advance of the g-pawn once he tightens up his position and gets his Bishop on its ideal diagonal. - -------------------------------� ANSWERS TO TESTS 435 Diagram 41a A picture perfect blockading Knight It's time to take a long look at the position after 2 ... c5. What has Black accom­ plished? One key point is that the e-file is now closed. White's pawns are also on dark squares-this pawn structure significantly curtails the usefulness of the e3 -Bishop. Once black's Bishop reaches b7, the superiority of this Bishop over its e3 counterpart won't be open to question. All of this should certainly make us feel good about black's prospects, but aren't we forgetting about white's protected passed e-pawn? Not at all! That pawn is closing down the e-file and is firmly blockaded by the e6-Knight. This fine, flexible, square (it allows the Knight to exert influence over c5, d4, f4, and g5) wouldn't be safe if the e-file was open, so some might label the e5-pawn as a traitor! Simply put, after 2 ... c5 white's pieces have no penetration points or targets to at­ tack. White also lacks a pawn break. On the other hand, black's pieces will prove to be far more active than white's, and the ... g7 -g5 pawn break will hang over the other side like the Sword of Damocles. 3.Radl Rooks belong on open files, don't they? White is happy to follow general rules, but he'll soon discover that the d-file is a road to nowhere. 3.. .Qe8 Quietly moving his Queen to safety while also giving his Knight some support. Other Queen moves like 3 ... Qe7 and even 3 ... Qh4 are also good. 4.Nc4 and now Black has to choose between 4 ... Bb7 (it would be hard to resist placing this Bishop on the tasty a8-hl diagonal) with ... g7-g5 to follow, and the im­ mediate 4 ... g5 5.fxg5 f4 with an immediate attack. This attack (now or in another move or two) is completely justified because black's Bishop, f-pawn, kingside Rook, Knight, and Queen would all take part in the festivities. Those who are dying to get more information on passed pawns and blockading will find it in Part Eight. 436 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N A:NSW1Ut •·PA::tt'r . two.· Diagram 42 [Level: 1600 - 1800] White to move This is from the game girl-brain - Brooklyn, ICC 2007. White wasn't sure what to do and, accordingly, played a move (1 .Bc3 ?) that actually hindered her proper plan. The key here is being aware of the holes on d4 and d5. Black needs to get a Knight to d4 as quickly as possible, and White needs to get a Knight to d5 at warp speed. Once you realize where your pieces should go, it becomes easy to find the correct moves to make it happen. However, if you are just mindlessly calculating moves with no real plan in mind, then you'll usually play something that has little or nothing to do with the needs of the position. In the diagram, White would love to play Nd2-b1-c3 -d5. However, moving the d2-Knight would result in the loss of the e4-pawn. Thus, defend the pawn! Explaining the Rating Spread: I would hope that players in the 1400 to 1800 range would recognize a huge hole and try to get their Knight to it. However, in this case e4 is weak, so this process calls for some patience. As a result, I upped the difficulty level to 1600. l.Rfel! Defending e4 and thus freeing the d2-Knight of guard duty.

Silman - S. Booth, Los Angeles 1987. Both sides have vulnerable queenside pawns (a6 for Black and b2 for White), but white's more active minor pieces and advantage in central space (which leaves Black con­ stantly worrying about both f4-f5 and e4-eS advances) gives him the better chances. At the moment the pride of white's position is the c4-Knight, but Black would love to exchange it for his far less imposing beast on d7 (via ... Nb6). When you look at the position in this fashion, white's first move shouldn't come as a surprise. ��plainin_g the Rating Spread: Though you might be getting used to Knight retreats by now, the solution is obscured by central possibilities, and chances to create pressure against a6. Also, White already has a Knight on c4, so why bring the other Knight to bear on that same square?

A glance shows that its many arms reach in all directions: of course, it eyes internal squares on a3, d2 , and e3 , but that's to be expected. It turns into a superhero when one realizes that it defends the pawn on b2, eyes aS (which can be a jumping off point to c6 via Nc4-aS-c6--this also means that when White starts attacking the a-pawn with Ra l, Black won't want to push the pawn to aS since that would walk right into the Knight's influence.), eyes b6, puts serious pressure on d6, and also takes a swing at eS (this prepares for white's thematic e4-eS push or, if f4-f5 is played, Mr. Octopus keeps the hole on eS from becoming terminal). 2 ...

As mentioned earlier, Knights usually don't tread on this rank, but when they do make an effective jump to the 8th there are often tactics at work. In this case the Knight makes use of the single most common tactical building block: an undefended piece (the d7-Rook being the culprit here).

By now, whenever you see a hole I would expect you to ask, \"Can I get a Knight there?\" And, after some reflection, you might notice that if a Knight could reach c4 then both holes would be accessible. Thus 12.Nd2 suggests itself. However, one must also take note of what the opponent intends, and this leads us to 12 .Nd2 Nc5 (we allowed it!) 13 .Qc4 b6 14.Bxc5 bxc5 15.Nb3 Nd7 with ... Ba6 to follow when Black is fine. Clearly, White needs to demonstrate a bit of subtlety (though you can be very proud of yourself if you noticed the Nf3-d2-c4 maneuver). Explaining the Rating Spread: Noticing the holes on b6 and d6 shows that you know your stuff, but finding a way to make use of these weaknesses by Nf3-d2-c4 takes it to another level.

White now played 13.d5 because he intended to begin an attack by h2-h4-h5 and the center needs to be closed to make this worthwhile-he also wanted to stop the f8- Knight from finding fame and fortune on e6.

Explaining the Rating Spread: Yes, another Knight retreat!

Part Two I Minor Pieces - Bishops Diagram 66 [Level: 1600 - 1800] Black to move Black's in trouble and has to make a painful decision: should he capture on d5 or retreat his light-squared Bishop? Giving up the Bishop isn't something one would normally want to do-it's not only a useful piece, but after l.. .Bxd5 both 2.exd5 (threatening to make use of the e4-square with g4 and Ng3 while also looking forward to an enduring attack against black's King), and 2.cxd5 (intending to continue with the usual kingside attack via Rbfl , g3-g4-g5, etc) favor White. However, like it or not Black must play that way! Why the urgency? Why create a tasty square for white's pieces or leave White with a readymade kingside attack? Why willingly go into an inferior position? The answer is twofold. First, you are already in an inferior position-we're seeking damage control, not equality (in other words, you need to be realistic). Second, the retreat leads to a far worse situation! 444 HOW TO REAS SESS YO UR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N Explaining the Rating Spread: Though I doubt that everyone would notice the potential strength of capturing away from the center with l. ..Bxd5 2.exd5 (though white's kingside attack after 2.cxd5 is pretty obvious), the real question is whether or not a player will see that f5-f6 is doable after l.. .Bd7 since a glance would tell Black that his f6-square is adequately covered. This makes the problem more than just a \"don't let your Bishop get entombed\" walk in the park. I would expect many class \"C\" players to see the downside of 1 ...

However, we already know that a one-pawn advantage doesn't guarantee victory when Bishops of opposite colors are on the board. Thus, Black will want to retain as many pieces as possible and show that his Bishop is a strong attacker that can go after things the other Bishop can't defend. To this end, control of d4 is critical since, from there, the Bishop will eye f2 while also blocking off the d-file. Note that the extra pawn allows black's Bishop to safely reside on d4, while white's Bishop doesn't have the same luxury. Ultimately, the extra pawn, superior Bishop, and iron control of the e-file should combine to give Black a winning game. Explaining the Rating Spread: The material advantage and black's control of the e-file is obvious, so that leaves black's grip on d4 as a major thing to notice. This is fully in a 1400's range. 21...Bd4 22.a4 b6 Black's in no hurry since White can't do anything (he has no targets to attack in black's position and no means to effect any useful penetration) but wait and hope that his opponent doesn't find a way to break through. When your opponent is helpless, it's always a good idea to tighten up your position. 22 ... b6 takes the pawn aware from the white Bishop's stare and also gives extra support to c5. 23.b3 Re5 24.Rd2 h5 This little pawn move is designed to create new weaknesses in white's kingside. 25.Re2 White is trying to trade everything he can in an effort to reach a pure Bishop of opposite colors endgame.

Rxe2 26.Bxe2 h4 27.Khl White isn't in any hurry to stop black's h-pawn with 27.h3 since that would leave a severe weakness along the h2-b8 diagonal.

White's Bishop on d2 can leap into activity via Bf4, but white's other Bishop seems to be hit­ ting granite on d5. Thus, white's first order of business is to crack open the center and activate the slacker on g2 . Remember: More often than not you have to make a Bishop active-you can't count on it to happen by itself! Explaining the Rating Spread: I know that Bf4 was tempting, but my main concern is that you noticed that your g2-Bishop isn't as active as it could be. If that simple thought crossed your mind, then I'm happy. And if you also decided to do something about the g2-Bishop's plight and decided on e2-e4, then prepare to be worshipped as a chess god. 2l.e4 dxe4 Worse is 2l.. .d4 22.Ne2 when the d-pawn will fall. 22.Nxe4 Nxe4 23.Bxe4 Now we can see that e2-e4 had another point too: it opened the d-file for white's dl -Rook and made the hole on d6 accessible to white's pieces. Mter 23 .Bxe4 white's advantage can't be in doubt: aside from the disparity in the state of both sides' light-squared Bishops, the weakness of the c6-pawn (which will be vulnerable for the rest of the game) means that White has a target and Black doesn't. 23 ...

Since white's Rooks should, theoretically, be able to dominate the Queen if he solidifies his position and kills off black's activity, Ivanchuk's move makes a lot of sense. Explaining the Rating Spread: I think most 1400s would notice the potential danger along the hl -a8 diagonal. And, since this section is all about Bishops, it stands to reason that the answer has something to do with them. Thus, 2l.Be3, preventing that diagonal from being opened by ... e4-e3 , is something well within a 1400's range. 2l.Be3 ! This blocks the e-pawn, which in turn makes sure that the hl-a8 diagonal won't become a factor in the subsequent play. 21.. .Qf6 22.c3 Bd6 23 .Nd2 Qe5! An important maneuver for Black. By forcing g2-g3 (24.Nfl is possible, but then the Knight would be relegated to passive defense), Black hopes use his Queen and a8-Bishop to take advantage of the subsequent light-square holes that this pawn advance created. The battle is very interesting: White is doing his best to block his opponent's light­ squared Bishop while Black is doing everything in his power to create new diagonals for it that will ultimately allow game-saving counterplay against the white King. 24.g3 h6 25.a4!

Capablanca - J. Corzo, Havana 1900 White to move A very famous game. The position is quite interesting. The main features are the opposite colored Bishops, white's two passed center pawns, and black's kingside pawn majority. At the moment white's center pawns are frozen in place. Black's kingside majority is chugging along, but the advances have left various weaknesses in their wake. Most pronounced (at least to my eye) is the sad situation of white's Bishop-the poor thing has been relegated to Tall-Pawn status. As we know, if you have such a Bishop, you need to either get it outside the pawn chain (thus making it active) or get the blocking pawns out of its way. These goals can be actualized by positional or tactical means. On the other hand, black's Bishop looks very nice! If he is able to create a permanent blockage on both e6 and d5 (for example, his Knight on e6, Queen on d7, and Bishop on d5) then he'll enjoy a significant advantage. So which Bishop will be the hero? Since it's White to move, it's his job to insist that his Bishop rules the day. Because the black King is sitting on the same diagonal as white's Bishop, it's clear that a transformation from Tall-Pawn to monster would ANSWERS TO TESTS 451 occur if those pawns were to suddenly vanish. Capablanca, then only twelve-years old, probably understood all this information in an instant. Then he uncorked one of his most memorable combinations. l.e6! ! ��El_�ni�� Rating Spread: If you realized that the Bishop on b2 was a serious problem, and if you noticed the potential along the al-h8 diagonal, and if you then did everything you could to rectify it, we can say you did very well. The rest of the solution is all about advanced tactics-but tactics that serve to make white's strategic dreams come true. The e-pawn sacrifices itself in an effort to clear the central dark squares and activate its Bishop. Another, far simpler, win was l.Qc4! Be6 2.Qxd5 Bxd5 3.e6 when black's posi­ tion falls apart (due, of course, to the opening of the al -h8 diagonal). For example: 3.. .Nh6 4.Re5 Rad8 5.e7, 1-0. l.. .Bb5 l.. .Bxe6 loses instantly to 2.Rxe6 when 2 ... Qxe6 3.d5+ picks up black's Queen. 2.Qxh5!! Sacrificing the Queen and removing the blockader on d5.

Many amateurs are programmed to quake in their boots when they realize their opponent has a queenside majority-\"Isn't that a big advantage?\" they ask. It can be, but center pawns tend to be more valuable in the middlegame and in positions where quite a few pieces still remain on the board. And, as we can readily see, white's center pawns give him a spatial plus (it's nothing huge, but it's something!). However, there's another battle going on here too: the battle of the Bishops! White has noticed that black's center and kingside pawns are all on light squares. If this were permanent, such a state of affairs would bode well for white's Bishop since the enemy pawns would be potential targets. Thus, White plays to fix the enemy pawns on light squares. Explaining the Rating Spread: This is all about finding subtle ways to create things that don't yet exist. Very advanced, which explains the rating spread. 17.g4! Excellent!

There's no hurry, and as I've said before: When you have an opponent passively waiting for his fate, take your time and improve your position as much as possible before undertaking any committal action.

Suffice it to say that White mixes threats against g6 (Bg8-h7) with a well-timed e5-e6 advance and decisive King breakthroughs to gain the full point. Note that all this is possible because black's pawns are on light squares and thus vulnerable to the enemy Bishop. The plan initiated with g2-g4-g5 has been a resounding success! 38.e6, 1-0.

This isn't the end of the world, but it does make his position rather inflexible. White's pawn on d4 gives him a central and queenside space advantage. In fact, the half open c-file, the c4-Knight, control over cS, and white's light-squared Bishop all make it clear that this is the area where White should try and make some inroads. Other than pawn structure considerations, the main imbalance is black's two Bishops vs. white's Bishop and Knight. However, the structure plays a role here too since the pawns are severely limiting the Bishops' activity. So the two main bits of information White needs to concentrate on is: --� Seek queenside play (an eventual minority attack with b2-b4-b5 is in the air). --� Optimize your Knights! 456 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Optimizing the Knights means bringing one or both of them to an advanced post where they can influence the upcoming queenside battle (remember that your whole army has to work for the same goal). Thus, the c5-square suggests itself. Once there it will hit b7 and, if it's chased away by ... b7-b6, the c6-pawn (which will be sitting on an open file) will be quite weak. Because the pawn structure favors White, and because the Knights are better suited to this structure, White will retain a small but annoying edge for some time to come. Explaining the Rating Sprea_<!_: This is far from easy because White not only has to be able to get his Knight to c5, but he also has to be aware of the Minority Attack. On top of that is the question about ... Bxe5 after white's Ne5. In my view, that's too much to take into account for anyone below 1900, but I would love it if lots of readers proved me wrong! 13.Ne5! Heading for d3 and then to c5 . Trying to get the e2-Knight to c5 isn't as effec­ tive: 13 .Nf4 Bxf4 14.gxf4 Bd5 offers equal chances, while 13.Ncl Bd5 14.Nd3 Bxg2 15.Kxg2 Qd5+ 16.Kg1 Ne4 is also fine for Black. Note that 13 .Ne5, in comparison to 13.Ncl, takes the Knight off the threatened c4-square. This means that 13.Ncl allows 13 ... Bd5 because the f5-pawn can't be taken (the white Queen needs to remain on c2 to defend the c4-Knight), but 13 .Ne5 Bd5 isn't playable since 14.Qxf5 picks up a free pawn. Of course, keeping the Knight on e2 has the added benefit that a well-timed Nf4 is still on the table. 13 ... Nd5 Other choices: 13 ... BxeS 14.dxe5 leads to some surprisingly complex positions that give White a bothersome initiative. A sample: 14 ... Nd7 (14 ... Nd5 is possible, but it doesn't put any pressure on e5 and thus gives White a free hand) 15.Qc3 Qb8 (Black's Queen isn't well placed after 15 ...

Expla!!li_�_g_ th� Rating Spread: Another hard problem. I think players under Expert would have trouble evaluating things. After all, Black's down a pawn and it does indeed look like black's Bishops are dead in the water.

This rips open the position and, in doing so, shatters white's illusions.

Exchanging pieces and leaving yourself with a minor piece that's superior to your opponent's is a basic but extremely important strategy. 15.Bg5! White plays directly for a superior Knight vs. Bishop position, which would also cre­ ate a permanent grip on d5. This move is both thematic and easy to understand: black's Knights are the guardians of d5, while white's Bishop will never be able to directly affect that square. Thus, White wants to swap off both black Knights, leaving him with a dark squared Bishop vs. (ideally) a white Knight lording over the board on d5. 15 ... Rfc8 16.Bxf6 Not best. Did you notice that white's f3-Knight had nothing to do with the em­ battled d5 -square from f3? It's important to hone your board vision so that you quickly recognize when pieces aren't well placed. One way to tell if a piece isn't carrying its weight is to ask, \"Is my piece helping the rest of the army accomplish the main stra­ tegic goal?\" If it's not doing so, it may very well be a slacker! ANSWERS TO TESTS 461 Correct was 16.Nh2, which instantly brings this Knight into the d5-equation: it intends to continue to g4 where (after Bxf6, getting rid of one enemy Knight) it can exchange itself for black's remaining horse (creating the hoped for great Knight vs. pas­ sive Bishop situation), or it can continue to e3 where it threatens to leap into d5 or f5.

Though going right for the queenside by 26 ... a4 followed by 27 ... Rfb8 would compensate for the inferior minor piece, Black wisely asked, \"Why can't I win both battles?\" Explaining the Rating Spread: I would be happy with any player un­ der 2200 that noticed both the minor piece battle and black's queenside chances. However, actually seeing and having the courage to play black's best move is quite another matter. It's very instructive, but also calls for a lot of vision, courage, and confidence. 26 ... e4!

This kind of thing, and the psycho­ logical processes involved in actually playing such a move, will be explored in Part Four, Psychological Meanderings. 27.Nxe4 Bd4+ 28.Khl a4 Black has been very methodical: first he activates his Bishop, then he forces white's King to step to the far right of the board (away from the real fight on the queenside!), and finally he begins his assault against white's queenside pawns. 29.h4?

Does this offer sufficient compensa­ tion for the material deficit? Probably not; let's not forget that white's Knights are very nicely placed, and if they can remain entrenched in the center, will certainly offer White a significant advantage. In other words, don't get fixated on the pawn and neglect the minor piece battle! Explaining the Rating Spread: I have a lot of faith in 1400 players, so I'm doubling down on them! Mter reading all the material on Bishops and Knights, I fully expect players in that range to have developed a sharp eye for support points. However, if that concept is still a bit vague, then Part Five (Target Consciousness) will add more than a little clarification. As we know, it's very important not to allow enemy Knights advanced support points (Anti-Knight Strategy!), so the thematic move is 24 ... b4!, weakening white's grasp of d4 and therefore depriving the Knight of a permanent support point there. After 25.c4 Bc8! Black stops Nf5 and, after more preparatory moves, intends ... f6-f5 depriving the other horse of its central home too!

However, at the moment black's Bishop is far stronger than either white Bishop (its control of the a8-h1 di­ agonal is terrifying), and the Knight also has far more possibilities than the enemy Bishops (it can leap to e4, d5, or even to c5 via d7). Why are the white minor pieces so ineffective? The answer is simple: the cl-Bishop isn't developed and can't seem to find a diagonal to call its own! ��!�}�i�K.��-!�!!�_g_�_E_��ad: I think some players would be misled into favoring White by his pressure against a7 down the a-file, and his two Bishops. Hopefully this problem will make you a bit more sympathetic towards Knights. The inability of the cl-Bishop to show its stuff leaves Black with a clear advantage. Now let's make a \"slight adjustment\" in the position: put white's e-pawn on e4, his f-pawn on f3, and his dark-squared Bishop on e3 . Diagram 103a Black to move Now White is better Suddenly black's advantage is gone and White is the one who possesses a significant plus. Everything has changed! The Knight can no longer rest on e4 or d5 and the b7-Bishop's diagonal has now been completely shut down. Let's not forget white's problem dark-squared Bishop. It's still a problem, but a problem for Black! Sitting proudly on e3 , it radiates power along two diagonals (g1-a7 and cl-h6). As you can see, simply owning two Bishops and expecting them to win the game for you shows a serious misconception! All the position's details need to be considered before making any kind of assessment. Returning back to position in the actual game (diagram 103), Black needs to make sure the cl-Bishop remains miserable and, of course, he needs to make sure White can't ever reach the fantasy situation mentioned above. 17 ...

Neither side has any serious weaknesses though, so there's no need for over-optimism from white's side or panic from black's. In general, there are two ways for the inferior side (in this case, Black) to play in such situations: one is to accept that you're worse and just improve your game bit by bit in an effort to steer the position to eventual equality and a draw. The other is to seek tactical chances, remembering that you can't force such things since overaggressive moves tend to create self-inflicted weaknesses and can make things worse. In the present case Black should carefully weigh both. The thematic \"go for it\" idea is 26 ... f5 (trying to get the b7-Bishop into the action), but 27.Rxc8 Rxc8 28.Bh3 Nf6 29.Rel leaves Black under serious pressure. Explaining the Rating Spread: Assessments should all be in the \"favor­ able to White because of her two Bishops\" box, but after that there's lots of nuance and wiggle room. Since 26 ... f5 didn't get the job done, Black should tighten up her position first. Perhaps a chance for ... f7-f5 will appear later, perhaps not. But there's no. shame in being realistic and accepting that the opponent's two Bishops are better than your Bishop and Knight. Once you make this sober determination, you should seek the usual anti-Bishop pair ideas (try to exchange one of the Bishops), get all your pieces into play, and create a solid \"wall\" that's devoid of weak points. For example: 26 ... Nf6 (Don't allow your Knight to rot away on the side of the board!) 27 .Rxc8 (27 .a4!?) 27 ... Rxc8 28.Rcl Rxcl 29.Qxcl Nfe8 with a solid but slightly inferior game. Okay, you might be scared to death if you were facing Kramnik here, but do you really believe that your non-Kramnik opponent has the technique to eviscerate such a position? After 30.Qc3 (30.Qc2 would stop any ... f5 nonsense-white's better, so why should she allow things to get out of control?) 30 ... f5 !

In the actual game, Black lashed out. 26 ... g5?! The idea is to crack e4 with ... g5 -g4. However, the poor placement of the h5-Knight and the fear that a further opening up of the position will favor the Bishops (which it usually does!) makes the push of the g-pawn rather dubious. Again: Unless you're sure that an aggressive/committal idea will bear fruit, don't embark on an adventure that will only add to your defensive chore by creating new weaknesses in your own camp! 27.Nc4 Nxc4 28.Rxd8+ Rxd8 29.Bxc4 Qf6 30.Be2 Rd7 31.Qb3 A nice move that threatens 32.Qa4, simultaneously hitting d7 and a7. 3l ...a6 32.b5 Diagram 1 04a Excellent play by Miss Krush (chess player names don't get any better than Krush)!

Explaining the Rating Spread: A basic assessment is pretty straight­ forward (thus the 1400 level citation). Deciding that exchanging white's Knight for black's poor Bishop is the way to go isn't straightforward at all (leading us to the 2200 level citation)! 18.Nc7!? A surprise, but it fits in nicely with our overview of Bishops. Carlsen realizes that the enemy Bishop, though ugly, is actually a good defensive piece (in other words, it's inactive but useful). Due to this, he exchanges the Bishop for the Knight, which will force the King to defend f5. 18 ... Rag8 19.Nxe6 Kxe6 20.Rxg8 Nxg8 The Knight is heading to e 7, where it will defend both d5 and f5 . However, 20 ... Rxg8 21.Rcl Rg2 22 .Ke2 Rh2 was a more active defensive possibility, with good chances to hold the draw. 21.Ke2 Ne7 22.Kf3 The King improves its position and, after some preparation, intends to take up residence on f4 where it will work with the Bishop in pressuring f5. 22 ... Rc8 23.a4 Rc7 24.a5 h6 25.h4 White is making spatial gains on both wings and is slowly but surely improving the positions of his pieces and pawns. The advance of white's a-pawn means that ... a 7 -a6 would fix black's queenside pawns on light-squares (this makes them vulnerable in the Bishop versus Knight endgame that can easily occur). If Black tries ... b7-b6 at some point, White can capture and use the a-file for a bothersome Rook penetration. Note that black's Rook can't do anything on the c-file because the Bishop covers c4 and c2, 472 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDIT ION while the b2-pawn covers c3. White's h-pawn will advance to h5 where it keeps the Knight out of g6. That allows white's King to go to f4 without fearing a Knight check. Once all this is done, White will improve the position of his Rook, mixing threats of taking the c- and g-files with attacking possibilities against the h6-pawn. I should add that all this is very advanced. Instead of feeling deflated by the com­ plexity of it all, I implore you to watch for two things: Diagram 105a Keep your eyes on the Bishop and how it constantly proves itself to be far more flexible than the Knight. Watch how White makes sure all his pieces are ideally placed. You're looking to absorb patterns here, not to understand reams of analysis or grandmaster level maneuvering! 25 ... Kf6 26.h5 Nc8 27.Kf4 Nd6 28.Rgl 28.a6!? was also interesting. 28 ... Rc8 29.£3 Very useful-e4 is taken away from the Knight (Anti-Knight Strategy) and e3-e4 becomes a possibility at the right time. Note that White has no interest in b2-b3 since, aside from being unnecessary ( ... Nc4 would hang the f5-pawn), it would block the bishop's access to a4 and give the enemy Rook access to c3 . After 29.f3, a near-zugzwang position has occurred: If Black moves his Rook off the c-file White would claim it by Rcl, if Black plays 29 ... b6, then 30.axb6 axb6 31 .Ral gives White the a-file, if Black moves his King to e7 then moves such as 30.Bxf5 or 30.Rg7 or 30.Ke5 all become possible, if 29 ... Rc7 then 30.Rg8 is very strong, and finally, if 29 ... Ke6 (as played in the game), then 30.Rg7 adds to black's woes. This means that, like it or not, 29 ... a6! (even though it fixes the queenside pawns on light­ squares) needs to be given a shot since White can't maintain the zugzwang-in that case 30.Rg2 Rcl gives Black counterplay, 30.b3?

There are several reasons why black's game is so miserable: __ ...._ The Bishop will be purely defensive since white's pawns will eventually all be on dark squares (meaning that the Bishop can't ever attack them). __ ...._ White's enormous kingside space advantage chokes both the black Bishop and King. __ ...._ This specific pawn structure allows a particular tactical idea (looked at in the notes) that will always torture Black from beginning to end. __ ...._ White's King can step on a dark square and be immune from the Bishop, but black's King can always be kicked about by the nimble Knight. All in all we're looking at a case of total Knight domination! 44.a3 Explaining the Rating Spread: I'm hoping everyone appreciated the superiority of the Knight. The real problem was in determining just how much better the Knight really is. First on the agenda is to clear away the b4-pawn. This in turn gives White access to c3 while also preparing a timely b3-b4 push.

The problem is that white's Knight is firmly guarding the pawn, nullifying the Rooks' efforts. Since your target is c2 , and since his Knight is defending that point while your Knight isn't doing anything at all about it, the correct plan should be easy to find. Explaining the Rating Spread: This is a problem that is solved by pure verbalization; you see your target, you see the defender, and you ask how you can get rid of that piece of glue that's holding his position together. I thought a 1400 might be looking for an aggressive way to break through and thus miss the idea of playing for a simple exchange. But I hope I'm wrong and that every reader 1400 on up found this easy. ANSWERS TO TESTS 477 34 ... Nc3! That's it! Black intends to follow with 3 5 ... Nb5 exchanging white's defensive horse.

There are two things of note here: Black would love to claim permanent owner­ ship of the d-file and there's a hole on d3. Two of the three moves mentioned in the problem don't address these concerns, while one does. Explaining the Rating Spread: You don't want to give Black the d-file, do you? I'm sure players in the 1400 range will find this an easy exercise. __ .... 27.g3 ? allows Black to have his way with the file and with the d3- square. He can grab the file forever with 27 ... Qd5 or 27 ... Qd6, he can clamp down on d3 with 27 ... c4 (followed by 28 ... Rd3), or he can leap to d3 (2 7 ... Rd3) right away. __ .... 27.Qb3+ sets a devious trap: 27 ...

This means that White can take his time and build up his position in any way he sees fit. White's extra kingside space-plus the fact that his Rooks, Bishops, and Queen are all aimed in that direction-offer him excellent chances of a successful kingside attack. I hope you also noticed black's g7-Bishop, which has earned full Tall-Pawn status! Dare we assign the h7-Rook honorary Tall-Pawn status too? The question about how you see this game playing out might seem odd, but a trained eye would conclude that Black might very well play ... g6-g5 at some point, leading to a well known pawn structure (we addressed it in Part Three, Rooks) with very clear plans to combat it. Huge kudos if you made that connection between one pawn structure and a very possible future one!

Portela, Havana 1913 Black to move White is two pawns down. Is he doomed? Though Black is two pawns ahead, he has no chance of winning this game because of the bind created by white's eighth rank Rook and powerful Knight. Black's King and Bishop are immobilized, and his Rook is stuck on its third rank in an effort to prevent Ne6, which would win the enemy Bishop. The game should be drawn. Explaining the Rating Spread: Two extra pawns sounds like a lot, but you also have to take the activity of white's pieces into account. I have faith that the 1400 players who are reading this book will realize that winning just isn't in the cards for Black. l...Ra6 2.Kg2 Rxa4? ! Apparently the mighty Portela isn't interested in drawing with his legendary opponent. It turns out that he had, earlier that year, already drawn a game against Capablanca in a simultaneous exhibition. He played Capablanca again a short time after that-three games at twenty moves per hour-and, though Portela lost the first two (in one he was doing fine but botched it), he seemed to have decided that only a win would do. One can imagine that, at this point, Portela might have thought that he was the superior player and was just unlucky. Thus, he decides to go all out for victory so he can end his series of games against Capablanca with some dignity! 3.Ne6 The Knight takes the first step of what turns out to be a memorable rampage.

Kudriashov, Moscow 1972 White to move White has two vastly different philosophical options. What are they? Black has two problems: His King is in the center and his queenside pawn structure is shattered. On the other hand, Black is hoping to castle and then generate an attack down the b-file by ... Rb8 and ... Qb7. White must make a big choice: Should he strive to punish black's central King by opening up the center, or should he keep things simple by somehow taking advantage of black's queenside pawn weaknesses (which will eventually lead to the fall of the a4-pawn and, as a result, material gain)? Explaining the Rating Spread: I think anything that asks for the phi­ losophy behind a position is advanced. And when you mix in two completely different viewpoints, then it's even harder! l.Bxc5 Karpov rarely chose risky tactical operations over a safe bind and positional suf­ focation. And, in this case, why should he? l.Bxc5 adds to black's structural mess and also removes one of the a4-pawn's defenders. Now his plan is simple: exchange all of the defenders of a4 and then win it!

In the first case White got rid of a dangerous attacking piece and completely destroyed black's pawn structure. Now he's trading off another queenside attacking piece, stripping Black of the two Bishops, and also ANSWERS TO TESTS 485 removing the a4-pawn's main defender. Each exchange is dicing down black's dynamic potential while also highlighting his weaknesses. Finally, note that 2.e5 is fixing the pawn structure (something Knights like) and also giving the Knight access to e4. In other words, he's also setting up a position where the Knight is stronger than the e7-Bishop. 2 ... Be7 Developing and preparing to castle. However, while the black King scurries to safety, Karpov continues to follow his plan. 3.Bxc6+ Qxc6 4.Qe2 Every move fits seamlessly with the others. White takes aim at a6, eyes a possible Qc4 (hitting a6 and a4 while also blocking the c5-pawn), and also has high hopes for Qe4 since the Queen exchange (which takes away the final defender of a4) leaves Black in a hopeless endgame. 4 ... c4 On 4 ... Rb8 White grabs hold of the c4-square by 5.Qc4 when 5 ... 0-0 6.Nxa4 is mission accomplished (White's a solid pawn ahead), and the sharper 5 ... h6 allows 6.g6! fxg6 7.Rhgl Kf7 8.Qd3 g5 9.Rdfl with a strong attack. 4 ... 0-0 allows White to fulfill his plan in a very pure manner: 5.Qe4 Qxe4 6.Nxe4 Rfd8 7.Rxd8+ Rxd8 8.Rdl Rxd l+ 9.Kxd l and the a4-pawn is a goner. With 4 ... c4 Black stops Qc4 and frees the a3 -f8 diagonal for his Bishop. 5.Qe4 By forcing the trade of Queens (notice that his whole plan was based on reducing enemy counterplay through exchanges) White ends Black's dreams of queen­ side counterplay once and for all. Not only is black's Queen the \"hammer\" for his b-file attack, it's also the last remaining piece capable of defending a4. Thus, trading it also leaves a4 defenseless. 5 . .. Rc8 5 ...

Explaining the Rating Spread: If you haven't seen the answer before, then this will prove extremely difficult even for masters, many of whom will feel (with some justification) that it simply can't be sound. 9 . ..

Nxfl) occur to you, or did the \"autopilot brain\" dismiss it instantly since it ob­ viously loses the Queen? This is, of course, very advanced and I don't expect you to find this kind of sacrificial sequence (so don't feel bad if you didn't!). However, once you go over all the examples in this section, once you ponder them and begin to view them as imbalance vs. imbalance, then you'll find yourself developing an appreciation and understanding of situations that appear to spit in the face of point count. Of course, 10.Bf2 is met by 10 ... Nxfl . lO ... Nxfl Initiating a positional sacrifice of the Queen! I've known several strong players who were very attracted to this idea but didn't really believe in its ultimate soundness. Nevertheless, I suspect there's still a lot to discover in this system and it might well prove to be better than its reputation. ll .Qxh4 Nxe3 12.Qf2 Nxc4 A very interesting position! Black has two Bishops and two pawns for the Queen. That's not a bad material tradeoff for the second player. He also has a solid position with only one potential weakness (c7), and Black knows that even if c7 falls, the time White takes to get it might allow black's army to get frighteningly active. Other than attacking c7, White only has one other plan: pushing the h-pawn to h5 in an effort to frighten black's King. ANSWERS TO TESTS 487 Diagram 158a ��� Though white's army doesn't work together very well and doesn't have many op­ tions as far as plans are concerned, Black has pawn breaks like ... c7 -c6 and ... f7 -f5, as well as all sorts of annoying Knight leaps. The dark-squared Bishop can occasionally turn into a beast on the h8-al diagonal if, after ... f7-f5, White captures on f5 and allows a later ... e5-e4. But even if this never happens, the Bishop can go to h6 with serious effect. In general, the position is very difficult for both sides to handle and its study will give you an appreciation as to just how well minor pieces can handle themselves when facing off against a Queen. Please keep in mind that I'm not trying to convince you to play this variation in your own games. The point is to break the conditioning that's left you with a fear of losing material, and to make you feel more comfortable when material imbalances are created. Here are two examples of White drowning in the kind of complications that result from this line. Both are filled with serious mistakes, but don't let that blind you to power of the black army once it's unleashed. I purposely didn't add notes. Just sit back and enjoy the carnage: L. Voloshin - J.

ANSWER PART FOUR ANSWERS TO TESTS 489 Diagram 160 [Level: 1400 - 1800] M. Blau - R. Fischer, Varna Olympiad 1962 Black to move It's clear that the c-pawn is the big target in this position and that Fischer is dying to chop it off. But this isn't a case of embracing one's \"inner greed.\" Instead it's the logical culmination of one player creating weaknesses in the enemy camp, surround­ ing it/them, and finally feasting as the targets fall. Clearly, the acquisition of material plays a huge part in chess strategy, but ideally one would like to do so in a controlled manner. Thus, one must take a few things into consideration: If too many pawns are exchanged, the side with a pawn less will, in some cases, still get serious drawing chances. In one's zeal to win material it's easy to allow unnecessary counterplay. Thus, Black should do his best to avoid giving White more play than he deserves. Which minor piece has more impact in the battle along the c-file? Since l.. .Rxc4 fails to 2.Nc6 Rxcl 3.Nxe7+ Kh8 4.Rxcl, black's correct move is self-evident.

Explaining the Rating Spread: Acrually, the correct move would be played by anyone who has been introduced to the idea in the past. It's a very common tactical device in the King's Indian Defense.

Black didn't wait to see if something nice happened to him with a move like 1 ... NbS, instead he made something nice happen-he created a litany of positive imbalances where none existed before. In siruations of this type (where everything seems to be against you), if a pawn sacrifice like this appears, you have to play it even if it is still a bit better for the op­ ponent (of course, I'm not saying that Black is worse here in any way, shape, or form). Why? Because being a bit worse with no play rarely ends well. But being a bit worse (and does anyone really care about \"- 0.20\" anyway?) with lots of play means that all three possible results are still actively \"on.\" I .· A.NSWER ·.

White gets it back in a couple moves and quickly turns an interesting position (after 17.Nxf4) into a positional rout! Keep in mind, it's okay to snip off a pawn if you're actually winning it and if you aren't giving your opponent too many other imbalances in return. But to waste time, not develop your pieces so they can push your own agenda, and to discover that you didn't even win a pawn after all (which would at least allow you to drown your posi­ tional sorrows in material gain) is simply a disaster!

If white's pawn still stood on the \"healthy\" e3 -square then Black could seek counterplay by ... e 7 -e5 .), more space in every sector of the board, and long-term pressure against the weak pawns on a6 and c6. Does Black have anything? He has two Bishops, but at the moment white's Knights are dominating them. Black's only other plus is white's central King, but if the center can't be opened then that might not amount to anything since the black pieces won't be able to reach white's monarch on el. The question was whether chopping on c6 was a good idea. In this case it gives Black far more play than he deserves after 14.Rxc6?! Nf6 15 .N c5 N e4 16.Nxe4 dxe4 17.Ne5 Rd8 18.Bc4 e6. Why give your opponent tons of counterplay (White might still be a bit better, but certainly no more than that) when there is more to gain by keeping a solid grip on the position? ANSWERS TO TESTS 497 ��_p!�ining the Rating Spread: White has a lot of advantages, so why give Black counterplay when you're in control of the game? I do appreci­ ate greed, though, and fully understand why 14.Rxc6 would be given a go. However, I suspect that more experienced players would hold off. In the actual game White wisely avoided the capture on c6 and instead pushed his own agenda by 14.h5 aS 15.hxg6 fxg6 (15 ... hxg6 was preferable, but still much better for White) when we get yet another chance to chop on c6. Diagram 165a In the game White again avoided 16.Rxc6 with the tightening move 16.g3 . This was a good practical decision and led to eventual victory. However now, thanks to the newly created weaknesses in black's King position, the circumstances have changed and taking the pawn was best: 16.Rxc6! Nf6 17.Nc5 Ne4 (17 ... Bd7 18.Ra6) 18.Nxe4 dxe4 19.Bc4+ e6 20.Ng5 with an overwhelming position. It should be clear that grabbing a material plus isn't always a no-brainer. In fact, if it gives your opponent too many positive imbalances then you should usually beat back the greed-impulse and look for a more controlled way to handle the position. On the other hand, if you were already in trouble, sacrificing material for counterplay (in the case of our last example, 14.Rxc6 allowed 14 ... Nf6 followed by 15 ... Ne4 when black's formerly passive pieces spring to life) is something you should get used to doing. Interestingly, the example in diagram 165 showed many psychological and practi­ cal nuances that are related to the giving and taking of material: We saw (on move 14) the defender offer a pawn for counterplay (demonstrating that he's transcended the \"I can't ever give away my stuff\" syndrome), we saw White wisely refuse it (not allowing the opponent to gain undeserved activity), then (on move 16) we saw White refuse to take a pawn that could have safely been taken. However, this decision is a very human one-when you have a positional lock, why go on tactical adventures (which might easily lead to an oversight) when you can continue to safely \"massage\" your opponent until he finally cracks and dies? 498 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Part Four I Psychological Meanderings - Mental Breakdown AN$WBR.

Part of that difficulty lies with the fact that players tend to get a bit freaked out when their King is being kicked about. There are only two choices for Black in diagram 17 6, but, as you've already seen, I found a third! I actually took quite a long think here. The first thing I did was reject 36 ... Kf8 since it gives White the chance to transpose into the same position reached after 36 ... Kg8 (3 6 ... Kf8 37.Rh8+ Kg7 38.Rxd8) while also offering him the extra pos­ sibility of 3 7 .g7 + Kg8 3 8.Rh8+ Kf7, which seemed downright terrifying. As it turns out, the terror was in my head, not on the board: 39.Rf8+ (39.Rxd8 al=Q+ 40.Kg2 Qa2+ 4l.Kf3 Rxd8 42 .Qc7+ Ke8 43.Qc6+ is also drawn) 39 ... Qxf8 40.gxf8=Q+ Kxf8 41.Qd6+ Kg7 42 .Qe7+ Kg8, draw. Since White can force the key line after both 36 ... Kf8 and 36 ... Kg8, I concentrated on that particular variation: 36 ... Kg8 37 .Rh8+ Kg7 38.Rxd8 al=Q+ 39.Kg2 Ra2 + (I didn't trust 39 ...

Time to put it to rest.\" I reached out (after 36.Rxh7+), said, \"I give up\" and shook Christiansen's hand. He looked at me in shock and said, \"I was about to offer you a draw! It's a per­ petual check or stalemate!\" He then played out the moves that led to the expected final position (previous diagram that occurred after 4l .Kh4) and slammed down 41 .. .Rxh2 +!! 42 .Qxh2 (42 .Kg4 loses) 42 ... Qf4+ ! 43 .Kh3 (43. Qxf4 stalemate) 43 ... Qg4+ 44.Kxg4 stalemate. Fortunately, there were no sharp objects within reach at that moment, and this allowed me to live to fight another day. And, as is so often the case, it proved to be a very important lesson. I realized that my negative frame of mind made it impossible for me to see what was really going on, and I understood that uncontrolled emotion should only be released after the game, not during. As a result, I worked hard to eradicate \"I can't\" from my psyche-in fact, I traded negatives like \"I can't\" and \"I'm doomed\" and \"It's hopeless\" to \"There's always a defense!\" The belief that one can fight to the bitter end and place serious difficulties in front of your opponent even in the worst of situations served me very well as my career progressed. And, when an opponent would play a dodgy move, I firmly embraced the mentality that it was \"Rubbish\" or it \"Had to be punished.\" .:. ��$�Jt, . . �iR.'t J?�tnt . ·,·'fl$sT . tl ·.

If you're 1400 and you saw this line, then accept a round of applause! ANSWERS TO TESTS 501 White has just attacked a7 and Black (who has an extra pawn and an obvious plus) would like to defend it.

Nc4 15 .Qxa7 Nxe3 16.fxe3 when the advantage moved to White (though she subsequently outclassed her opponent). What could possibly have spooked her? It turns out that she noticed 14 ... Kb8 15 .Bf4+ Ka8 16.Bc7 and felt she was in trouble. Yes, it looks very threaten­ ing-both the Rook and Knight are under attack. But since 14 ... Kb8 is the dream move, you really need to defend it and do your utmost to prove that the position after 16.Bc7 isn't a problem for Black. Sadly, she didn't make the effort-the threat scared her and that was that. End of story. Time to look for a different 14th move. Of course, by now you know that a successful player can't afford to be psyched out by mere threats. You need to turn on your \"insist that there's something good for you\" mindset and look hard for the move that will once again make you master of your domain. One way out would be 16 ... Nc4 17 .Qc3 Rc8 18.Qxc4 Rxc7 but Black certainly can't speak of an edge after 19. Qxf7 . Since girl-brain failed to find the optimal solution, let's try to calmly pose the problem verbally.

However, it also involves one of our brain melting phrases: \"He can't\" (as in, \"Mter I defend my Rook he can't take it.\").

And he was ANSWERS TO TESTS 505 also known to write a lot of his material without use of a board (he did the analysis in his head and then just wrote it down). But my theory is far simpler: he was a victim of \"He has to\" or \"He must\" (as in, \"Black has to take on b5 and then White has to take on c7.\"). Once you get into that mindset, you simply continue with it-thus the first \"Black has to take\" led effortlessly to the \"and White has to recapture\" that followed. Diagram 179a \\Vhite to move This brings us to an excellent training recommendation: After playing in an event, sit down and annotate all your games in depth. Don't only input the moves! Also write down why you played them, why you made all your decisions (plus write down why you felt your opponent made his choices). Don 't use an engine until after you finish your analysis! Once your notes are complete, use an engine (or go over them with your chess teacher). You might be surprised to find that you fell victim to \"I can't\" or \"He had to\" over and over again. Once you see this happening in your own games, you personalize the problem and can then begin the process of rectifying it. To finish up, Alekhine was right about 40 ...

The game continued according to Miss Koneru's plan: 29 ... Re2 30.Re2 Rxe2?? Here Black was expecting 3l .Bxe2 since White clearly \"had to take back.\" Sadly, something else occurred! 3l.Be4+, 1-0. It's mate after 3l. .. Re6 32 .Bxe6. Many players have been put on suicide watch when nightmares like this happen! But why did it happen? And, if you fell for the same thing, why did you miss the obvious mate? The answer is simple: once you embrace \"He has to\" then you see nothing except your own self-imposed lie.

Analysis isn't necessary! l.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.e4 Nc6 5.Be2 a6 6.0-0 Qc7 7.d4 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Nxd4 9.Qxd4 Bd6 lO.Khl Be5 ll .Qe3 0-0 12.f4 Bxc3 - Diagram 181 Explaining the Rating Spread: The game itself is extremely advanced, but the real purpose of this example is to show how falling into \"I have to recapture\" mode can blind you to possibilities that deserve at least a bit of exploration. The only moves that can even be remotely considered are 13 .bxc3 , 13 .Qxc3 , and 13 .e5. Everything else just loses a piece for nothing. If you noticed all three, then you solved the problem (even if you thought that 13 .e5 had to be garbage, the fact that you noticed its existence is important). However, many players will have missed 13 .e5 as a result of being in \"I have to recapture\" mode. White's down a piece and it's obvious that he \"must\" get it back. However, it turns out that there are three playable ways to do this: 13 .Qxc3 allows 13 ... Nxe4, but White gets some compensation on the dark squares after 14.Qd4 f5 (14 ... Nf6!?) 15.Be3 . 13. bxc3 is the move that occurred in the actual game: 13 ... d6? (1 3.. .e5 is better) 14.Ba3 Rd8 15 .Rad 1 Ne8 16.e5 dxe5 17.Qxe5 Rd7 18.Kg1 Qxe5 19.fxe5 Rb8 20.c5 f6 21.c4 Nc7 22 .Bf3 fxe5 23 .Bb2 , 1-0. Both these moves fall within the confines of the \"I have to recapture my piece right away!\" mindset. But our third choice, which also regains the piece, is something that's far harder to find. 13.e5!! So much for \"I have to recapture.\" Of course, this is an extremely advanced example. Don't let it depress you (no, I don't expect you to play moves like 13 .e5). Instead, use it as an illustration that shows how a blanket \"I have to\" can affect players of every level. If \"I have to\" even torments grandmasters, then you can rest assured that it's a large part of everyone's game-it's a serious disease that few even realize exists! 508 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION 13 ...

This would convince many players to \"obey\" and defend the pawn, but Kretchetov refused to give the \"threat\" any respect and instead went ahead with his own agenda while ignoring black's. Explaining the Rating Spread: The threat of a capture with check would freak out many players, and it would be perfectly understandable if they decided to keep things safe by any one of a number of solid choices. 34.Rd7! Moves such as 34.e4 and 34.g5+ Kg7 35 .Rd7 Kf7 also win (though in this last line, black's King has been allowed to join in the defense), but 34.Rd7 snuffs out all real resistance. 34 ...

White has more central space and, if al­ lowed, will play c3 -c4 when the b7-Bishop is a nonentity and hopes of queenside play by Black will be a lot dimmer than they were a moment before. So, how can Black make sure that he obtains active pieces and good overall chances? One quite reasonable idea is 12 ... e6 (maintaining queenside options while striking out at the center) when 13 .c4 exd5 14.cxd5 (14.exd5? Re8+ 15 .Be2 Nb6 16.0-0 h6 17.Bf4 Ne4 gives Black far too much activity, while 17.Bxh6 Rxe2 ! 18.Nxe2 Nxc4 19.Qcl Bxh6 20.Qxh6 Bxd5 is in black's favor) is about equal, and 13.dxe6 fxe6 14.0-0 leaves Black with nice center pawns ( ... d6-d5 would build a large central front) while White hopes to pressure them and prove that the \"nice\" center pawns are actually targets (moves like Rfd 1, Bf4, and or Bc4 will all be possible ways to prove his point). Tiger, a very aggressive player, felt he should be able to get more than 12 ... e6 offered, and he immediately strove to push his own agenda in the most dynamic way possible. Explaining the Rating Spread: A 1400 player might well toss out the excellent 12 ... e6. But the move I'm really looking for is a much harder proposition. 12 ... c4! Taking his fate into his own hands! This move gets his hoped for queenside play under way (After 12 ... c4 it's no longer \"hoped for,\" it's now a reality!), and frees the c5 -square for the d7-Knight. If White retreats the Bishop then Black has gained time, while if White captures on c4 the c-file will be opened and Black gains additional time with ...

After 13 .Bxc4 Black has to make a decision: should he play 13.. .Qc7, 13.. .Rc8, or first take on c3? Personally I feel that 13.. .Rc8 is the most flexible choice since the immediate 13.. .bxc3 14.bxc3 Rc8 gives White the additional possibility of 15 .Qa2 . Since I'm just trying to show some of black's dynamic possibilities here, we'll settle for the immediate Rook move. 13 ... ReS 14.Bb3 Black has to be happy after 14.b3 bxc3 15 .Qc2 , when both 15 ... h6 and 15 ... Nb6 give him excellent play. White might consider 14.Ba2 !? bxc3 15 .bxc3 when Black will have the usual choice between 15 ... Nc5 !? and 15 ... Nxd5 (which transposes into 14.Bb3 bxc3 15.bxc3 Nxd5). 14 ... bxc3 15.bxc3 Nc5!?

In other words, it's advanced (but highly instructive) stuff. 512 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION The late Tony Miles was a far better player than I ever was, but that's no excuse for the horrible psychological dive I made in this game. When entering the position in diagram 197, I had intended to play 13 ... b5! 14.a4 Nc5 !? 15 .Nd2 (15 .bxc4 bxc4 16.0-0 Ne4 17.Qa5 Qd8 favors Black) 15 ... BfS 16.axb5 Nd3+ 17.Bxd3 Bxd3 18.bxc4 dxc4, but then I got spooked by 19.£3 when white's King will sit comfortably on f2 (I wasn't worried about 19 .Nxc4 Qg6). I immediately suffered through an emotional crash, thinking that all my calculations were garbage. I suddenly lost faith in myself; after all, I was playing Miles and he had undoubtedly seen and rejected my whole line. Filled with self-loathing, I raised the flag of positional surrender with 13 ... cxb3 ? and died like a coward with no play and no hope: 14.Qxb3 (Black has a passive game due to his three pawn islands-b7 and d5 are under pressure, a3 -a4-a5 will chase black's Knight if it moves to b6, and 0-0 followed by Rfc l can easily lead to White penetrating down the c-file.) 14 ...

I bowed to \"I can't. __ ..,... I irrationally feared the \"all seeing eye\" of the superior opponent. __ ..,... Once I noticed something that hadn't occurred to me, I immediately gave up on my variation. Remember: if you don't defend your analysis, who will? The fact is that the unimaginative (lazy) 13 ... cxb3 is just a bad move. Rather than accept a passive position with long-term positional woes, it was my job to wave my fist at the \"easy way out\" and demand more from myself-! needed to make my original intention work since it offered active pieces and a somewhat unstable white King for me to gnaw on. Such \"key\" moments occur often, and find you balancing between heroism and doubt. The lines you might look at don't need to be complicated, but they do need a confident general to make them work. As it turned out, my intended variation was fully playable: 13 ... b5! 14.a4 Nc5 !? 15 .Nd2 Bf5 16.axb5 Nd3+ 17.Bxd3 Bxd3 18.bxc4 dxc4 19.f3 and now 19 ... a6! offers Black enough counterplay: 20.b6 (20.bxa6 Rxa6 21 .Rxa6 Qxa6 22.Kf2 Ra8 23 .Rcl Qa2 23 .Kg3 Ra3 25 .Qb4 Ra4 with a draw) 20 ...

How is such a thing possible? Well, the first move, not making the autopilot re­ capture, is what I expect from readers of this book in the 1400 class. But Christiansen's lovely tactical follow up is something that might be missed by players of a very high class. 33 .Rd8 White will only recapture on e5 if a lull in the action appears that allows him to take without any loss of initiative or momentum. 33 ...

Of course, if you can profitably bash the opponent some more, then by all means do so. However, usually a successful raid leaves one's pieces scattered about-they no longer work together for any particular goal. If that occurs, it's best to regroup, make sure your King is safe, and only then push on in an attempt to acquire new gains. In the position after 36 ... Bg7 White has a solid extra pawn and two rampaging Bishops. There isn't any reason whatsoever to risk anything here! Yes, a Rook can be captured but that leaves your King to fend for itself.

Since this section is about pushing your own agenda, I have full confidence that my 1400 rated readers will show Black who's boss! 21.b5! 516 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION This move does more than just continuing with your chosen plan (which is important to do), it shows your opponent that you're not worried about his kingside display and it also puts your own brain on track by telling it that fear won't be accepted and you'll only respond to your opponent if there's a real threat to deal with! For those who aren't familiar with the well-trodden minority attack, here's a quick primer: White uses two pawns (his a- and b-pawns) to attack an enemy pawn majority (since it's 2 pawns vs. 3). The goal is to open lines on the queenside (the files allow white's Rooks to penetrate into the enemy position, while the c5-square can easily become a nice home to one of white's Knights) and, after a mutual capture on c6, to create a permanent pawn weakness that White can attack right into the endgame. 2l. ..h4 Black doesn't blink either. He knows that if he doesn't get something going against white's King, he'll end up defending passively on the queenside forever. 22.gxh4 Qxh4 23.bxc6 bxc6 24.Ne2 A very nice move-the Knight retreat accomplishes two things at once: it allows its Queen to create an immediate threat against c6 (which means that 24.Ne2 was an attacking move) and it also prevents ... g4-g3 (which means that it was a defensive move too). 24 ... Kg7 25.Rfbl White knows that he will have the game firmly in hand (black's queenside weaknesses aren't going away) if he can prevent the enemy threats from becoming a reality. Of course, he could have chopped on c6, but that would have allowed his opponent to swing a Rook to h8 (after the f8-Knight moves) and pray for a knockout blow. Instead he plays another duel purpose move: 25.Rfb l places the Rook into attacking position on the queenside while also freeing the fl -square for the other Knight-by setting up a firm defense, Black will be left with no hope at all. 25 ...

Against best play this move actually hastens his demise (2 3 ... Nd7 was more resilient, when the ... gS idea might come at a better moment), but Mr. Russell deserves credit for it nonetheless-by offering a pawn Black hopes to gain several positional trumps and, ideally, a bit of counterplay. The move also has some psychological impact. International Master Anthony Saidy, an American chess legend, was feeling very confident -he had completely outplayed his lower rated opponent and expected a trouble free victory. When 23 ... gS was played, I can imagine Dr. Saidy refusing to give the move any credit at all. On the other hand, Black had already put his poor opening play behind him and had announced to his opponent that, \"I don't intend to go quietly into that dark night!\" So what's good about 23 ... gS? A glance at the position after 23 .g4 will tell you that White has much more space and he's about to eat a free pawn (aS). On the other side of the board, it's hard to see where black's play is coming from-none of his pieces have any advanced squares to call their own. With that in mind, one can begin to understand the point of the 23 ... gS pawn sacrifice: after 24.fxgS Nh7 the Knight will take up residence on gS, the Bishop will rule the board on eS, and the dark-squares 518 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION around white's King are suddenly severely weakened. In other words, even though Black might be clearly worse after 23 ... g5 24.fxg5, his pieces will find some activity and he'll have some imbalances that he can be proud of. Explaining the Rating Spread: If you saw what Black was after, and if you were macho (and wise) enough to deprive him of his hoped for posi­ tional/dynamic trumps, then you should feel really good about yourself. Though I started the spread at 1800, if those in the lower rating groups also got on top of this problem, then expect a rapid rise up the rating lad­ der! Of course, you shouldn't feel any shame if you didn't solve it since Saidy himself failed to do so in the actual game. So a subtle psychological shift had occurred, and White didn't catch it. In the actual game Saidy chopped on g5, missed several big chances, and ultimately fell victim to his dark-squared weaknesses: 24.fxg5 Nh7 25 .Nd5 Be5+ 26.Khl Rbc8 27 .Rxa5 Nxg5 28.Ra7 Ne6 29.Rfl Ra8 30.Rxa8 Rxa8 3l .Qf2 Bg3 32 .Nf6+ Kh8 33 .Qf5 Qh6 34.Nh5? (34.e5! was very strong, opening the hl-a8 diagonal for the white's Bishop and also giving white's Knight access to the e4-square) 34 ... Be5 3 5 .Qf2 N g5 36.Qxh4 Ra2 37 .Rbl Kg8 38.Qf2 Qg6 39.Qc2 Kf8 40.Qb3 Ra8 41 .Rel Ne6 42 .Rfl Nd4 43 .Qe3 Ra2 44.Rbl Ne6 45 .Qb3 Ra8 46.Ng3 Qg5 47.Nfl Qh4 48.Qe3 Ra2 49.Qel Qxe l SO.Rxe l Rxb2 Sl.Rd l Nf4 52.Rd2 Rb l 53 .Rc2 Re l 54.Kgl Bd4+ 55.Kh2 Ne2 56.Bf3 Be5+ 57.Kg2 Nf4+ 58.Kf2 Nd3+ 59.Kg2 Ra l 60.Re2 Nf4+ 61 .Kf2 Nxe2 62 .Bxe2 Ra2 63 .Kf3 Ke7 64.Bdl Ra3+ 65.Ke2 Bf4, 0- 1. So Black was in trouble all the way through, but he had some weapons (the weapons he created with 23 ... g5) and, after various white mistakes, they came through for him. Though 24.fxg5 retains a significant plus, White should have asked himself, \"Why should I give my opponent anything of worth? Why does he deserve all that dark­ square control? Why does he deserve any piece activity? Is there any way I can stomp this guy into jelly?\" In fact, throwing in a \"Kill!\" wouldn't have hurt either! If Saidy had held this dialogue with himself, he wouldn't have had any trouble finding a far better move: 24.e5!! Now this is a macho move! 24 ... dxe5 No better is 24 ...

In the game position Black had access to the e5-square, his Bishop was very active, and white's Bishop was a horrible piece. By inserting 24.e5 dxe5 we've changed all that: now black's Bishop is dead, black's pieces don't have access to eS, white's Bishop rules the wide open hl -a8 diagonal, white's Knight has access to e4, and white's Queen is on a fast track to fS . By playing 24.e5 White deprived Black of everything he dreamed of getting while adding to his own already large list of advantages.

Qe7 27.Bc6 Red8 28.Ne4 White has achieved a fairytale position: almost all of his pieces are ideally placed, all of black's pieces are unemployed, and the light-square blockade is a wonder to behold. If we add that black's pawns are weak and his King can easily fall to a mating attack (White can play Rfl followed by Nf6+ ), one can see just how hopeless black's cause is. To sum up: in the actual game White made his opponent happy with 24.fxg5 be­ cause it gave him a few stones to throw (meaning, it gave him hope). On the other hand, 24.e5 would have immediately deflated his opponent's dreams and left him with nothing but the misery of a passive, hopeless defense.

Both sides need to deal with their central King since things can get nasty if one side's monarch gets stuck in the middle while the other castles to safety. Since White can't afford to get too defensive (that would leave Black with an easy development and the aforementioned space), he has to take a stand and ignore black's pseudo-threats to d4. 520 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N Explaining the Rating Spread: King in the center, not bowing to enemy threats, pushing one's own agenda. If these things don't spur you into to action, then nothing will. I have full faith that my 1400 rated audience will shine here. 9.0-0-0!

John Grefe, who won the U.S. Championship in 1973, was half a point behind his Canadian opponent (who won the Canadian Cham­ pionship in 1972 and 197 5) and needed a win to take the event. And, it seemed he was going to get it! He had outplayed Biyiasas, was three pawns up, and seemed well on his way to the American Open title. Peter Biyiasas was famous for his defensive powers and his never-say-die attitude-he fought to the bitter end in every game he played. Be that as it may, nothing could have saved him if White had played 40.Ra7. However, how could an obviously strong move like 40.Ra8 be incorrect? The threat of Rf8 (ending all counterplay on f4) followed by Qa8 (creating a nasty mating threat) seems to end the game quickly.

The players agreed to a draw since 44.Kxg3 (44.Kfl Qxf2+ 45 .Kxf2 is the same result) leads to immediate stalemate. A stunning save!

However, I also felt that it was impos­ sible to lose such a position and, as a result, I stopped paying full attention, expecting victory to happen by itself. In the present position White has a far superior pawn structure, a significant space advantage on the queenside, and a powerful Knight vs. a Tall-Pawn (i.e., black's very bad Bishop). It's hard to find anything that Black can be happy about. As a result of all this \"basking in the glory of my position,\" I got lazy, wrote my opponent off, and forgot that even a badly wounded animal can and will bite. Usually I'm very careful about avoiding enemy counterplay. However, here I just couldn't imagine him creat­ ing anything. Explaining the Rating Spread: The first thing Black has to do is realize that he's on death's door. Once he comes to terms with that, he'll be able to embrace guiltless desperation. Being honest about one's position and then being able to kick any and all soft moves away in favor of going for the gusto is far from easy. 27 ... b4! A star move. Computers don't like it, but if black's pawn can't move to b4 then his pieces will be doomed to eternal passivity. In that case Black would have to wait around and pray that White can't find a winning plan in the center or on the kingside. 524 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N After the pawn sacrifice, black's Bishop (which had Tall-Pawn status for most of the game) can enter the battle on b5 and his Rooks suddenly get use of the b-file.

In Winning With Chess Psychology (Benko and Hochberg, McKay Chess Library 1991), the authors state: \"Lasker was often called lucky by those who failed to appreciate his theory that chess was a fight between two personalities. It was his understanding of human fallibility that led him, in 1926, to make the following remarkable asser­ tion in his Manual of Chess: 'He who has a slight disadvantage plays more attentively, inventively and more boldly than his antagonist who either takes it easy or aspires after too much.

Probably not, but I'm hoping that the 1400 players reading this book will! Black's a Rook and a pawn down, so it's completely hopeless.

Explaining the Rating Spread: The spread is large since different rating groups will show different levels of depth regarding the answer. Players in the 1600 range should notice the central King and white's lead in development. I would be very proud of any 1600 student who noticed these factors and played 14.a4 (trying to open things up). White's best moves, though, are far harder to find and call for players in the \"A\" and Expert categories. I'm not expecting you to find the tactics that follow Gust seeing the logic of moves such as 14.a4, 14.b4, or 14.Nb3 is good enough), but those who did are surely title-strength players. In the actual game, White didn't show a very good sense of Target Consciousness and played the quiet 14.Nfl ? when the following occurred: 14 ... Ne7 15.Ng3 Bg6 16.Bd3 0-0 17 .Qe2 Bf7? (Both 17 ...

In the play that follows, White heaps attention on every one of these points. l.Rb4 Explaining the Rating Spread: There are weak squares here (thanks to black's bad structure) like f5, f4, h5, and h4, but I would hope that the 1400 player would have embraced his inner greed by this time and, due to this, would have already started drooling in the direction of every one of black's pawns.

Explaining the Rating Spread: There's a bit of a rating range here because, although 16.a4 creates weaknesses in black's camp, Black gets potential access to holes on cS and c3 . I should also note that b3 is a bit delicate. It would take a player on the higher end of the stated rating range to notice the plusses for both sides after 16.a4 b4. 16 ... b4 17.Bd2 Instantly targeting the weakness on b4.

ANSWER PART FIVE Diagram 267 [Level: 1400 - 1800) J. Baird - M. Weiss, New York 1889 Black to move White has just played the strange (and bad) Bd4-h8, no doubt thinking that this Bish­ op can just go back and forth since it holds the c3 -pawn on this diagonal. White most likely also felt that his own King could assure his kingside pawns safety from the hungry eyes of the c4-Bishop, while black's King has no way into white's position. As a result, White must have been confident that his defensive fortress would hold things together. However, it soon becomes clear that Mr. Baird was oblivious to the strategic subtle­ ties of the position. 534 HOW TO REAS SESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Explaining the Rating Spread: At the moment the only vulnerable points in white's position are c3 and g2 . However, can Black create a third target? By now, the 1400 players reading this book will be aware of the necessity of creating targets and not just wishing they would appear. l.. .c5! Very strong and also quite annoying. Seeing that the c3 -pawn can't be undermined, Black cracks b4, thereby turning a5 into a weakness. Then white's defensive task will be far more difficult since he will have to deal with two weak points on the queenside instead of the lone one on c3 . The ability to not just notice weaknesses, but to also create them, is a major part of Target Consciousness. 2.bxc5 Bxc5+ Simple and good. Black refuses to be sucked into obscure adventures with 2 ... Bc7 3.Nd4 Bxa5 4.c6, and instead regains his pawn while maintaining safe, long-term advantages like two active Bishops vs. Bishop and Knight, and pressure against both c3 and a5. 3.Bd4 Bd6 Black has no intention of relinquishing his two mighty Bishops! 4.Ke3 White could have put up better resistance by 4.Bb6 (defending a5), but even then his game would have been miserable after 4 ...

So, instead of giving White a square, he lashes out and annexes one for himself! Explaining the Rating Spread: Another problem, another example of creating a weakness rather than hoping that one will appear. I start the level at 1800 since white's 18.g4 could easily strike fear into the hearts of many players, and the solution seems odd since it opens the f-file so the fl -Rook gets a birds eye view of black's Queen. 536 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDIT ION 19 ... e4! White targeted a square and Black does the same thing! As I said earlier, weak squares usually don't just magically appear-a player has to create them. And, if it costs a pawn to do so, it's a small price to pay for winning the strategic battle. 20.fxe4 f4 Black has a clear advantage. Why? Black's Knight will dominate the board from the juicy hole on e5, white's kingside is open and vulnerable, and the f4-pawn will prove to be a very active participant in the coming battle. Note that white's extra pawn (on e4) actually blocks its own pieces-the c3 -Knight can't live on e4 anymore, and the d3 -Bishop is locked in by the c4 and e4 pawns.

This screams for immediate action! 13.f5! Explaining the Rating Spread: Solving this one called for recognition of the central state of black's King, and of 13 .f5, which tries to start a war before the enemy King manages to run to safety. You didn't need to do more than this to solve it. White had to get the ball rolling since both his advantages (development and black's central King) are temporary (black's King will eventually castle and he'll eventually catch up in development). Thus, I knew that I had to use it or lose it! Once again, I'm trying to instill in you a primal desire to kill whenever you see a King in the center. First comes recognition of the opponent's possible predicament, then comes the desire to punish it, and finally comes a cool and calm look at what is really going on in that particular position. 13 ... gxf5 14.Bxe7?!

However, there is no effective way to bring a third attacker to bear on it. The problem is that White has a monstrous pawn center and his pieces are poised for a kingside attack. Since the center and the kingside are white's, Black must break though on the other side of the board or, ultimately, perish. Other than the ideal ... Qd8-d7-a4, which maximizes the pressure against c4 (though this maneuver can be stopped cold by a2-a4), the general way to get play in these positions is to attack c4 with the Queen from c6 or e6 and induce d4-d5, which gives Black use of the c5-square and also allows for ... c7-c6, which will open the c­ file for black's Rooks. Unfortunately, the only way to do this is by ... Qd8-d7-c6 or ... Qd8-d7 -e6. However, while Black is spending precious time trying to create a subtle shift in the pawn structure, white's kingside attack will wash the black position away. Explaining the Rating Spread: It takes a pretty sophisticated player to fully appreciate when a known setup is and isn't effective, and when one side's well known plans are overshadowed by the opponent's.

Since 11 .0-0 Bxc4 isn't going to offer enough compensation for the pawn, he needs to look elsewhere in an effort to generate some kind of dynamism in exchange for his inferior structure. Explaining the Rating Spread: I would expect most players to notice that the c4-pawn is hanging. However, some might just shrug their shoul­ ders and give it up (without getting much compensation) while others might vainly try to hold onto it with 11 .Qa4, without bothering to see how Black would respond. A solid 1400 player should notice these things and realize that White doesn't really have much choice-it's either 11.c5 or bust! Of course, the prospect of ending up with doubled isolated c-pawns (via 12.. .bxc5) could easily spook him! 542 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION I would considerably raise the rating-bar for black's play-fighting the desire to double white's pawns on move 12 would be tough, and 12 ... d6 followed by taking away from the center breaks an age-old rule (\"always capture towards the center\") . ll.c5!

Black removes one of white's best attacking pieces, which, after an eventual e4-e5, would exert annoying pressure against black's kingside. 12.Qxd3 d6 Black is trying to saddle White with a structural disadvantage without dynamic counter chances.

At the moment we can see that black's pawn structure is inferior to white's, but the very doubled pawns that we label as \"potentially weak\" also have dynamic plusses: the g-file is opened for a black Rook and the e5- and g5-squares are inaccessible to white's pieces. Black's thematic break is ... c6-c5, but at the moment he has to deal with the threat of h4-h5. The tactical 16 ... e5 is possible (though 17.h5 Bf5 18.Nh4 Be6 19.Bxe6 fxe6 20.dxe5 Bxe5 21 .Nf3 is in white's favor), but the most obvious replies are 16 ... h6 and 16 ... h5 . Explaining the Rating Spread: Many players would notice 16 ... h5, but few would play it with the express purpose of sacrificing that pawn! 544 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N The knowledge needed to fully handle this position (knowing the proper pawn breaks and willfully giving up a pawn for dynamic compensation) requires someone with experience and strength. 16 ... h5! Since black's pawn structure is made for dynamics, he needs to \"up\" the tempo of play by seeking ways to make his pieces as active as possible. On the other hand, White would be happy to slow down the tempo of play, make the important ... c5 advance hard to achieve, and leave Black as passively placed as possible. It turns out that 16 ... h6 isn't best due to \"1 7.h5 Bh7 18.Ne3 when Black has a weak pawn at h6 and ... c6-c5 is rather hard to carry out\"-Ponomariov (New In Chess 8, 2003). His point is that 18 ... c5 is met by 19.d5 when the dual threats of 20.dxe6 and 20.Ng4 (picking up the pawn on h6) are simply good for White. 16 ... h5, though, is a different animal. Now Ng2 -e3 -g4 ideas are ruled out because the h-pawn controls g4 (and, of course, there is no pawn on h6 to win), and black's ... c6-c5 push is about to become a reality. Of course, Black paid a price for this: White can play 17 .Nf4 and win the h-pawn (giving White another static plus in the form of an extra pawn). However, the Ng2 -f4xh5 idea takes time, and Black will use that to maximize the activity of his army. This will no doubt be very confusing for lower rated readers of this book. But there's really only one lesson you need to absorb here: You can't play a position properly without understanding whether your chances lie with statics or dynamics. Once you know which your (and your opponent's!) position is dedicated to, you can insist on moves that promote it! 17.Nf4 Bf5 Less exciting but playable is 17 ... e5!? 18 .Nxg6 fxg6 19.dxe5 Nxe5 20.Rhe1 Ng4. 18.Nxh5 c5 This is the position Black was aiming for: he's a pawn down but the key ... c6-c5 advance has been realized. Also, white's Knight has been sidelined and needs to be defended by the Queen. The game now becomes very exciting with many tactical tricks popping up all over the place. 19.g4 Other moves: 19.d5? works well in the position after 16 ... h6 17.h5 Bh7 18.Ne3 c5 19.d5, but it doesn't hold up here (after 16 ... h5 17.Nf4 Bf5 18.Nxh5 c5) because the Knight is loose on h5 after 19 ... c4! 20.Bxc4 Ne5 threatening 21.. .Nxc4 and 21.. .Bg4. 19.dxc5 Nxc5 20.Bc3 Be5 21 .Bxe5 fxe5 \"when Black still has a dangerous initiative\"-Ponomariov (New In Chess 8, 2003). __ .._ The critical choices are 19.Be3 !? and the non-human 19.Ng7.

White keeps trying to put a stopper on black's activity (dynamics) so he can make use of his extra passed h-pawn and better overall structure (statics).

Black has been compelled to hand back one of his Bishops and he remains with doubled c-pawns-a losing disadvantage, as we know, if ever we reach a King and pawn endgame. That said, he is not without his prospects: the white e-pawn is particularly vulnerable and can only be protected at some inconvenience. While the statics may favor White, the dynamics are certainly in black's favor and thus an evaluation of approximate equality is in order. \" Explaining t�e Rating Spread: This kind of position mixes ideas that can be easily grasped by players in the 1400 group (i.e., putting pressure on a pawn and making use of one's active pieces) with the subtle-more advanced-nuances we see in the actual game. Before moving on, let's address Mr. Short's comment about the doubled c-pawns being a losing disadvantage in a King and pawn endgame. One of white's dreams is to exchange all the minor and heavy pieces, which could easily lead to a position like this: Diagram 291a White to Move If it was Black to move, he would actually win by making use of a well-known trick: l...a3 ! 2.bxa3 b3! and the pawn will turn into a Queen. 552 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N However, an experienced player would be alert to this possibility and would play l.a3 ! when black's crippled pawn majority is stopped cold. In effect, this means that Black is a solid pawn down in the King and pawn endgame. To win, all White has to do is to create a passed pawn on the kingside, find a way for his King to penetrate into enemy territory, and that will be that. l. .. g6 Obviously, moves such as l...bxa3 2 .bxa3 or l. ..b3 would leave black's queenside pawns completely immobile. 2.g4 Also possible is 2.h4 h6 3.g4 Kd6 4.h5, but 2.axb4?? cxb4 3.cxb4 c3 loses for White. 2 ...

In this position he can't afford to play too quietly 554 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION because White is ready to make even more central gains with f2-f4. Thus, energetic play is required if Black wants to hold the balance! Explaining the Rating Spread: I think players in the 1600 class will fully understand that Black has to chip away at white's center before it becomes too strong. The analytical details, though, are best tackled by the upper limits of the rating spread. In the actual game, Black failed to halt white's central ambitions: 16 ...

However, it would probably take a higher rated player to realize the true severity of black's situation (after all, black's position doesn't-visually-seem that bad!). Why are things so grim for Black? Because he doesn't have his usual kingside counterplay and, without kingside chances, white's queenside attack will roll him off the board.

Clearly, Black can't afford to let this continue! Explaining the Rating Spread: Things seem very complicated and it would be easy to miss white's intention to take on e5 followed by c4-c5 with a huge spatial clamp. Thus I gave this problem a high rating spread. Of course, I hope you lower rated players did notice white's threat to en­ velop the queenside and, by doing so, proved me completely wrong about what the spread should be. 2l...Bg7? Instead of stopping white's plan of world domination, Black quietly developed his Bishop to a reasonable looking square and let White have his way! By now we know that the indignity of suffocation can only be tolerated if some sort of counterplay allows the spatially challenged side to make use of enemy squares weakened by the forward marching pawns, or if we have our own things happening in another sector of the board, or if the space gaining pawns can be viewed as attackable targets. In the position that occurs, Black achieves none of these things and thus ends up with an uncomfortable, passive position. Though 21 ... Nh5 is more aggressive than 21 ...

On a basic level we can say that Black has queenside space, so he will seek play down the b-file against the b2 -pawn. However, this is by no means the whole story­ there's a lot more going on than that! White's d4-d5 has given him a clear advantage in central space, but he paid a price for it: the c5-square (which was controlled by the white pawn on d4) is now black's, and a Knight on that square leads to control of two other weak squares in the enemy camp: b3 and d3. Once you realize these things (the weakness and connections of the c5, b3, and d3 squares) then black's most logical move should be obvious. ANSWERS TO TESTS 559 Explaining the Rating Spread: If you noticed the holes on c5, b3, and d3 and saw how to use them (19 ... Nd7), then take a bow.

The Knight wasn't doing much on f6, so it begins a short journey to c5 where it will attack white's Rook and prepare a leap into d3 . Compare the Knight on f6, where it's a rather unimposing critter, and c5, where it's a mighty Octopus-its tentacles reaching deep (and in all directions) into the enemy position! 20.f4??

Explaining the Rating Spread: These ideas were clearly discussed, so an alert 1400 should know them. If you don't (no matter what your rating may be), reread Part Seven, Space until the lessons there fully sink in. 9 ... e5!

However, white's central space advantage still exists and black's King seems to be a bit drafty. White decides it's time to use that space advantage to create concrete play on the kingside. 26.e5! Explaining the Rating Spread: A tough one since it looks like Black achieved something nice by getting his Knight to d3 . However, if you saw that White could use his center to strike at the enemy King, then you should consider yourself a very good player. ANSWERS TO TESTS 561 Black had the initiative for the whole game, but suddenly White cashes in his fine static center for a host of dynamic considerations: 1) 26.e5 blocks black's dark-squared Bishop; 2) It frees the e4-square for white's Knights and Bishop (thus the one pawn move activated three white minor pieces); 3) It intends to crack open the black King with moves such as e5-e6 or f4-f5 . 26 ... f5 I'm not sure what the best defense was, but the change in momentum had to be psychologically difficult for Black to deal with.

Explaining the Rating Spread: I expect everyone reading this book to feel revulsion at the sight of 20.a5. 20.a5?? This move should create a scream of horror and agony (it should actually be both psychologically and physically painful to see) by any spectator who happened to pass by. Yes, it gains more space, but what good is space if there's no way to penetrate the enemy position in that sector, or if that space doesn't stop your opponent's play? By playing 20.a5, White has deprived himself of any active plan while giving the green light to Black. Never accept (let alone willingly create !) a position where you are helpless and have nothing better to do than watch your opponent mass his army in ideal fashion at his leisure.

Black obviously felt (or hoped!) that the pawn would be a goner on c6, but that's not at all the case! Explaining the Rating Spread: A 1400 player will realize that 2 5 .c6 is forced, but would he be happy about the ensuing Exchange sacrifice? For that particular part of the puzzle, I moved the scale up a bit to Class \"B.\" Whether players in this rating spread notice that they will have to give up an Exchange or not (I pushed the scale up again to 1900 for those that see the Exchange sacrifice coming), they will readily appreciate the follow-up. 25.c6 e5+ 25 ...

Diagram 375 [Level: 1800 - 2200] White to move Who is better, and by how much? This is a hypothetical position that occurred in an analysis of]. Laurier - M. Sharif, Port Barcares 2005. White's first move is obvious, but then we get into some difficul­ ties. The real answer, which doesn't need much analysis, is based on a concept: White can force a Queen vs. Queen endgame where White possesses a far advanced passed pawn. In the theory section, we already learned how enormously advantageous passed pawns are in this kind of endgame, so playing for that position and simply having faith in a positive outcome would be good enough. Explaining the Rating Spread: Basic tactics aside, I think seeing past the flash to the resulting Queen endgame would leave serious questions in many players' minds. Things like, \"Doesn't Black have chances for perpetual check? \" and \"Can't black's King waltz over and help its Queen stop the d-pawn?\" would nag at most players under \"A\" class. l.Qxe6+ Kh8 2.Rxg7 Far worse is 2.Qe7 Rg8 3.Rxg7 Rxg7 4.d7 Rxe7 5.d8=Q+ Kg7 6.Qxe7+ Kg6 7.Qe6+ Kg7 when White is obviously much better, but there's still a long fight ahead. Why settle for this when 2.Rxg7 is gin? 2 ... Kxg7 3.Qe7+ Kg6 4.Qxd8 You have to acquire faith (this comes from experience, which you're getting now) that this kind of passed pawn plus Queen endgame is usually a slam-dunk win unless the stronger side's King is so vulnerable that he can't avoid perpetual check.

Kramnik quickly shows that this is all an illusion. Explaining the Rating Spread: Though we looked at a very similar situation and answer in Part Eight, Passed Pawns (diagram 358), it tends to psychologically disturb a whole range of players to such an extent that I've given it a very high level of difficulty. Even masters sometimes can't bring themselves to play the right move here! 10 ... £5! Handing White a protected passed pawn on a platter! However, it also kills the dynamism of the white pawns. Now Black will: 1) play to increase his control over the blockading e6-square; 2) support his own pawn majority so that he can advance it. Ideally, with white's e-pawn firmly blocked and his own pawns rushing forward in dynamic frenzy, Black will be able to claim an advantage. ll.Nb3 Na6 12.Be3 Nc7 Heading towards e6 while simultaneously giving support to d5 in anticipation of an eventual ... c6-c5 advance. 13.Ne2 b6 14.Nbd4 Ba6 The Bishop shows alarming activity. 15.Qd2 Qe8 16.c3 c5 By taking control over the d4-square, white's Knights are forced back to squares where they can't influence e6. Thus 16 ... c5 wins the e6-square and allows Black to claim victory in the blockading war! 17.Nf3 Rd8 18.Rfdl Ne6 A dream setup for Black Black's vision has come together nicely. He has two Bishops, a firm blockade on e6, and a mobile pawn majority. Also note how white's pawns on e5 and f4 are blocking their own pieces! Black eventually won (after various errors and adventures). ANSWER ANSWERS TO TESTS 567 Diagram 377 [Level: 2000 - 2200] P.R. von Bilguer - T. von Heydebrand und der Lasa, Berlin 1837 White to move White has an extra pawn. Is it a weakness that can be nipped at and eventually eaten? No, it's a protected passed pawn! White also has two Bishops while all Black can brag about is a lead in development. Surely White must be much better? But, here comes another \"no\"-Black actually enjoys excellent compensation (note that I'm not stating that Black is better, just that he has real compensation)! The reasons for this are simple: ••..,... Black has all the play while White will be forced to take a defensive stance for a long time to come. ••..,... The passed g-pawn isn't going anywhere. ••..,... The light-squares around white's King are vulnerable. ••..,... Black's play is easy to find-double on the h-file and go after \"Fred\" on gl. Of course, most chess engines will leap on white's bandwagon and proclaim black's inferiority to all who will listen. However, don't let yourself become a \"Fritz slave\"! Don't deprive yourself of instruction just because your computer is clouding your mind with a numeric (soulless) assessment. In his notes to Leko - Kramnik, Linares 2004 (New In Chess, issue 3, 2004), Kramnik wrote the following witty and penetrat­ ing words about the masses of players who were following his game live: \"Black has quite good compensation for the pawn, I considered during the game. 'White is +0.72' thought the numerous online spectators.\" �?'=.E!�!!ling the Rating Spread: Owning an extra protected passed pawn while also having two Bishops and having traded Queens (the usual knock­ out punch when it comes to kingside attacks) would make most players lean towards white's position. When you add my rather cruel act of giving White the move (usually indicating that white's in charge) to the equation, it would be a rare (and very strong) player who would give Black his due. 19.Nfl Black also gets plenty of play after 19.c4 (1 9.Kg2 !?) 19 ...

On the other hand, a Bishop isn't the best of blockaders-note how the d3 -Bishop looks more like a Tall-Pawn than a Bishop. Clearly, while a Knight can block a pawn and show great activity from the blockading square, a Bishop can easily find itself in a purely defensive posture when holding back an enemy passer. Though White doesn't have a passed pawn of his own, he does have a very mobile queenside pawn majority. Indeed, after a4-a5 Black will have to constantly worry about the further expansion of white's queenside pawns. Explaining the Rating Spread: We've looked at this kind of thing in the Passed Pawn section, but that doesn't make black's correct move any less difficult to come to terms with. Quite simply, it's something most players just can't bring themselves to do! 16 . .. a5! White is handed a protected passed pawn on a silver platter, yet Black is more than glad to do so. Why?

Black now prepares ... f7-f5, which will give him chances for a kingside attack (if the f-pawn is allowed to continue on to f4) and central domina­ tion if White captures on f5 .

Does White possess anything that would allow him to put a little pressure on his opponent? The answer is yes-the queenside majority. Explaining the Rating Spread: By remembering the fact that a passed pawn often reaches its peak of strength in a Queen endgame, White can play a move that normally wouldn't occur to most players. In other words, it takes some knowledge about passed pawns to make the following deci­ sion. I wouldn't think that a player under 1600 would ever willingly swap Bishops and allow his kingside structure to be crippled. Hopefully, a lot of people reading this book will prove me wrong. 29.Bf3 ! 29.c5 bxc5 30.bxc5 e5 is very comfortable for Black, e.g. 31.Bf3 e4!

For example, 17 .Rd 1 N c8 18.N c3 N d6 leaves Black with a comfortable blockade and a perfectly playable position. This means that White has to either take en passant and go for active piece play or retain his passed d-pawn and strike before Black can achieve his ideal setup. The second plan would call for moves like 17 .Rcl (hitting c5) or 17 .a4, in both cases trying to create weaknesses in the enemy queenside majority. Explaining the Rating Spread: I would be happy if a class \"B\" player (1600- 1 799) appreciated the strength of a d6-blockade and decided to go for 17 .dxc6 e.p. Some will and some won't, but I also think class \"A\" players will be similarly divided. Would 2200 rated masters find this easy? No, I'm sure that quite a few would fail to fully appreciate this position's many nuances. 572 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION I won't give an analysis of 17 .Rcl or 17 .a4, but I highly recommend the student explore both moves in detail! Instead, we'll see how the actual game progressed. 17.dxc6 e.p. Ripping open the center in an effort to make maximum use of his superior minor pieces.

How can I accomplish that? \" then you did very well. If you also noticed that c4 is weak and that a Knight on d6 would add to the pressure against that point (not to mention e4), then that's even better. And, finally, if you thought that Black has a great game (despite the d-pawn) while also noting that you would love to answer a3 -a4 with ... a5, then you're nothing less than a hero! Explaining the Rating Spread: It's one thing to know you want a horse on d6, but it's quite another to go out of your way to make it happen. That \"I insist\" mentality is rarely found in players under 1600, though it's also often lacking in players far above that rating too. 22 ... Ne7 The idea is simple: Black intends to swing his Knight to d6 via c8 . Note that the c8-square also allows the Knight to give b6 some support, something the other route ( ... Ng6-h8-f7) doesn't do. 23 .a4 Bc8 24.Kh2 a5! Nice! Though this leaves b6 weak, it also leaves White with a serious weakness on a4. Note that b6 would have been weakened in any case after a4-a5xb6, but then White wouldn't have that weak a-pawn. Thus, 24 ... a5 is clearly an excellent move. 25.Qg2 Bg4 26.Be2 Bxe2 26 ... Bd7 was a logical alternative since it ties the white pieces down to the defense of a4. However, Smyslov understood that exchanging Bishops (even though white's Bishop has that Tall-Pawn look) was the right thing to do since it highlights the weakness of both c4 and e4.

One might think it's simply good for White, but Black is solid and has ideas like ... aS or ... b5 followed by ... b4-both would solidify the c5-square for black's Knight and challenge the supremacy of White's bishops.

Diagram 409 [Level: 1600 - 2000] E. Rozentalis - G. Jones, Queenstown 2009 White to move The Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez gives White the superior pawn structure (a healthy pawn majority versus a crippled one), but in return Black gets two Bishops and potential pressure down the e­ file against white's e-pawn. In the present situation, Black can also play with the idea of ... f6-f5, opening the position up even further for his Bishops. How should White handle this position? ANSWERS TO TESTS 577 l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.0-0 Bd6 6.d4 exd4 7.Qxd4 f6 8.b3 Ne7 9.h3 Ng6 10.Ba3 Nh4 ll.Qe3 Nx£3 + 12.Qxf3 0-0 - Diagram 409 Though White usually tries to get mileage from his healthy majority, there's just no way to get even a drop of honey from that kind of plan since Black is not only solid, but also has active shots like ... f6-f5 . Because of this, White has to eschew his usual ideas and try and create a situation where he will be able to put a bit of pressure on the enemy position. To accomplish this, he needs to change the pawn structure so that Black will have a target that can be reached, and pressured, by white's army. The answer to these ruminations is 13 .Rd 1 followed by 14.Bxd6, undoubling black's pawns and also ending any talk of a pawn majority for White! It seems anti­ intuitive-in fact, does it even make sense? Yes it does! White's logic, in a nutshell, is that it's better to have a target one can reach and attack than a \"someday I'll be able to use it\" static plus that doesn't offer active play or a clear plan. Explaining the Rating Spread: This one's tough because a player often falls in love with whatever positive imbalance he has and fails to notice that it doesn't allow him a way to get anything from it. To make matters worse, the idea of undoubling the opponent's pawns is unthinkable! It's something most players would reject out of hand. 13.Rdl!

Leko - T. Radjabov, Morelia 2008 White to move This is a position from the Sveshnikov Sicilian. Both sides played the opening logically and White has emerged with a small edge. Both sides have active pieces. Black has some pressure against b3 and would love to get his central pawn majority moving by ... d6- d5. Though White has definite designs against a5, his immediate goal is to stop black's dream of ... d6-d5 so that the d-pawn will remain a static weakness instead of a dynamic plus.

Bosch - E. Gufeld, Telex Finals 1978 Black to move White has just played his 7th move and has absolutely nothing. Obviously, it wasn't a very good opening choice. So, what we have here is something White hadn't deeply studied and almost certainly something Black hadn't prepared at all-he was on his own. What is black's most pronounced favorable imbal­ ance? Once you find that, you'll fully understand and appreciate the moves that follow. l.N£3 g6 2.d4 Nf6 3.e3 Bg7 4.Be2 0-0 5.b3 c5 6.Bh2 cxd4 7.Nxd4 - Diagram 41 1 Though positive black imbalances like a slight lead in development and being castled while White isn't are nice, the real answer concerns black's central pawn majority. Simply put, if you noted the central pawn majority, and if you gave it the respect it deserves (instead of just saying, \"Oh, a central pawn majority ... who cares?\"), then black's play from this position is not only something you would understand and ap­ preciate, but also something you could find yourself if this position appeared in one of your own games. Explaining the Rating Spread: I think any player 1400 and up who is conversant with the imbalances should be able to take note of black's central pawn majority. And, once you notice it, you can use that informa­ tion to find a plan based on that particular imbalance. Our answer is over and done with, but don't stop here !

These things add up to no less than a winning advantage for White! Since you would like to continue developing your army, and since you want to make the e6-square your own, and (finally!) since you wouldn't mind getting your pawn back, the right move shouldn't be hard to find. Explaining the Rating Spread: It's not hard to see that one side is ahead in development, and the weakness of e6 should strike your brain as if it were a gong (though this is most likely the one thing that a player under 1400 might miss). Mixing that with the desire to regain your pawn and prepare for castling means that white's best move is something any player would do from 1000 on. 7.Bxc4 Moves don't get more natural than this.

White has an extra pawn (a static plus) while Black enjoys active pieces and pressure against a2, b4, and e5 (his position is driven by dynamics). White would love to castle, develop his forces, give e5 firm support, and then either go for active queenside play with a2-a4 followed by an eventual b4-b5, or simply solidify his pawn structure with a2-a3. Black, who is a pawn down, has to turn the game into a fistfight. Time is of the essence, and Black needs to keep White off balance by creating threats against the aforementioned pawn weaknesses on a2, b4, and e5. Mter he deals with his attacked g4-Bishop, moves such as ... Ng8-e7-f5 and/or ... Ra8-a4 will follow, increasing the pressure on white's position. Explaining the Rating Spread: If you noted that Black is down a pawn and needs to play actively, and if you noticed that the g4-Bishop is hanging, and if you saw that 1l.. .Bxf3 not only gains time but also ruins white's pawn structure and gives the black Knight a wonderful hole to leap to on f5, then you've done very well. In the actual game, Black played the hideous 11 ... Bh5 ?, literally handing White a free move. When I asked about this, Black told me, \"I retained my Bishop because I wanted it to keep control of the light-squares.\" Thinking like that can pay dividends in a different kind of position, but when dynamics are your life-blood, a more energetic treatment is called for. Correct was: ll ...BxB Obvious and strong.

However, now the heat is on since her Bishop's pinned and, if it falls, she'll be down a pawn for nothing. Explaining the Rating Spread: If you saw black's correct 25th move, congratulations. However, if you defended the Bishop, thus allowing the curse of \"I have to\" to tell you what to do, then you should go back and reacquaint yourself with Part Four, Overcoming the Trap of \"I Can't\" and \"I Must\". Here's how the game went with girl-brain's comments: 25 ... Re5 \"I had to defend my Bishop so my move was forced.\" 26.e4 Bh6 ANSWERS TO TESTS 585 \"Trying to mix things up a bit.

Did you notice that Black was swimming in the world of \"I can't\" and \"I have to\"? First off, take a look at her comment to 26 ... Bh6 where she states that she can't play 26 ... R:xe4. Of course, that's the move Black would like to play since it would regain her lost pawn. But, instead of staring at it and trying to make it work by dint of pure willpower (since if it doesn't work, you're pretty much going to lose), she simply ac­ cepted her fate. What's the truth about 26 ... Rxe4? Let's give it a closer look: 26 ... Rxe4 27.Rxd5 27 .Nxd5 Kh8 is fine for Black. 27 ...

This means that Black has to try something like 31.Qa5 Rc8 32 .Nf6+ Kh8 33 .Qc3 Bf8! and, though white's still considerably better after 34.Rel, Black can still put up resistance. Is that the end of the story? No, going back to the position after 26 ...

All this is extremely complicated and, to be honest, beyond most player's analytical ability. However, it shows that there was a whole world hiding behind girl-brain's \"I can't\" and, if you don't look and insist, you'll never come close to finding that hid­ den trove of unnoticed possibilities that will turn a certain loss into something a lot more upbeat. I should add that this whole defensive nightmare began with her comment on the 25th move: \"I had to defend my Bishop so my move (2 5 ...

Further \"confirma­ tion\" of white's superiority appears when one realizes that White has an active pawn majority on the kingside, and the pawn cascade f2-f4-f5 does indeed look threatening. However, doesn't Black have something to be proud of too? Yes indeed, and you can expect a world of pain in most of your games if you don't take the plusses of both sides into account! In the present position, black's trips give him control over quite a few important squares (b5, b4, b3, d5, d4, and d3). The d5-square in particular will prove useful since black's Bishop will find that it's a nice home. Black is also a pawn up, but that doesn't have much impact on the general play (after all, white's one pawn on c3 freezes all three of black's trips). All in all, black's position is perfectly acceptable! Explaining the Rating Spread: I think that many masters would au­ tomatically give White the nod in this position. If you managed to look past the negative aspects of the tripled pawns and realize that Black has plusses too, then you can be quite proud of yourself. 21.. .Bd5 22.f4 Rab8 23.f5 Qg5 24.Qf2 Rxbl 25.Rxbl Rd8 26.Rdl Rb8 27.Rd2 g6?

Whereas the Bishops alone herald a probable draw, the presence of major pieces usually leads to sharp battles, the reason being that nothing can challenge the Bishop, so the control of the respective diagonals may be indisputable. It is often the case therefore that in such positions each side plays on 'his own' diagonals. Thus two elements are highly important: the safety of the King and the pawn structure. In the present game White has two weaknesses (c3 and a2), whereas black's pawn formation is rock-solid.\" Explaining the Rating Spread: I would expect everyone who has read this book to notice the inferiority of white's pawn structure. If you got excited by the prospect of total domination of the c4- and d5 -squares then all the better. And, if you noticed the Bishops of opposite colors and real­ ized that black's Bishop will enjoy a better diagonal than white's, you can consider your efforts on this problem to be a job well done. 20 ...

Miles, Riga Interzonal 1979 White to move It's clear that White is winning-he's up an Exchange and his passed c-pawn is about to become a Queen. In such positions (where the game is all but over) it's important to take your time and make sure that the opponent doesn't have any threats or tricks. Sadly, Bouaziz, thinking that Black was about to resign, failed to exercise that last ounce of caution that would have netted him the full point. l.c7?? Explaining the Ra�_ing Spread: This problem is a perfect example of a \"pay attention!\" moment! It should be clear that you're winning, but by now you should also know that when you think the game is yours you must look long and hard for any potential counterplay so that you don't botch it. Of course, White should have taken a long think and tried to get a handle on exactly what was going on here. I often tell my students that if you move fast in an interest­ ing position, it shows that you're not enjoying the game. Instead, you should let your clock tick a bit and just absorb the wonder of it all, while also making sure that you're completely in tune with every secret the position might hold. If Bouaziz had done this, he would have noticed black's trick and played l.g5 ! (giving white's King access to g4 after ... Rxh3) when Black really would have resigned! 2 •.• Rxh3 ! After suffering from a shock like this, it's critical that you sit back for a long think (if you have the time, going out for a breath of fresh air is also a good idea).

White has pressure against the backward pawn on c6 while Black has pressure against the back­ ward pawn on b3 . On top of that, White is fighting to control the c5 -square, which in turn prevents Black from making the ... c6-c5 freeing move. And, to continue our tale of balance, Black has a firm grip on b4. I should stress the enormous importance of the c5 -square-if Black is allowed ... c6-c5 he'll quite likely have an edge since his main weaknesses will evaporate, while white's weak pawn on b3 will remain. Since White can't dent Black on the queenside, his last hope for advantage rests on the kingside. Thus, 38.gxf5 suggests itself. Explaining t�� __ Rating Spread: While it's easy to see the good things White has (pressure against c6 and c5 and chances on the kingside), not many players also take their opponent's plusses into account.

In this game he demonstrates a plan that he was very fond of: create a pawn majority, turn that majority into a passed pawn, and promote the passed pawn. In our problem position, I had hoped that you would notice white's four vs. two kingside pawn majority and also note that black has a four vs. two queenside pawn majority. Clearly, both sides need to make use of their majority and prove that what they have is more important than the opponent's. Explaining the Rating Spread: This problem is all about the respective pawn majorities. If you noticed them, then consider the puzzle solved.

He should have played 20 ... Kh8, though his game would have been very bad in any case. 21.b3 White quietly defends a2 and simultaneously threatens Bc4. However, the more pointed 2l .Nd6 (intending a smack-down with 22 .f5) was crushing. In this case white's pawn majority isn't trying to make a passed pawn, but is instead being used to smash the enemy King. 21...b5 22.g4?! 22 .Nd6 intending f5 was still strong.

Also, black's position is more or less devoid of counterplay. Other than this, two things stand out: ••..,.. Black wants to blockade the passed pawn by swinging his Knight to d6 . •• ..,.. There's a Bishop vs. Knight battle brewing! Ideally, White needs to swing a Knight to the permanent support point on f5 . This will help challenge the potential blockade on d6. Swapping off a pair of Knights (and then moving the remaining Knight to f5) would be wise, since the resulting Knight vs. Bishop battle is clearly in white's favor. ��aining the Rating Spread: I know you 1400 players noticed the passed d-pawn and realized that Black will try to block it by placing his Knight on d6. However, if you also realized that White should seek a swap of Knights (which ends black's dream of a comfortable blockade) by plac­ ing a Knight on f5 then you did very well.

Since the center is locked, and since the Rooks aren't doing anything, Black needs to employ pawn breaks to open files for his Rooks and give himself some space for his pieces. The most common King's Indian pawn break is ... f7 -f5 (gaining kingside space and instantly activating his Rook on f8), while ... c7-c6 (trying to open some queenside lines) is also a thematic try in quite a few KID systems.

ANSWERS TO TESTS 597 Explaining the Rating Spread: This problem is all about closed posi­ tions and the need for pawn breaks when such structures occur. Once you realize that ... f5 is black's main idea, Nh4 makes perfect sense (whether it's good or not is another matter). Of course, after 12 .Nh4 Black shouldn't panic. Moves such as 12 ... c6, 12 ... Na4, and 12 ... Bd7 have all been tried with reasonable results-black's idea in all these cases is to seek play on the queenside while ignoring the h4-Knight, which is effectively stranded and unable to help when a battle erupts on the other side of the board. ANSWER PART NINE Diagram 422 [Level: 1600 - 2000) White to move Does Bb2 make any sense? l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3 c6 5.e3 a6 6.c5 Nbd7 7.b4 g6 - Diagram 422 If you said, \"No, it doesn't make any sense because the Bishop is nothing more than a Tall-Pawn on b2 .\" then I would applaud you for not wanting to waste a developing move to put a Bishop on a square that you deem to be a dead end street. Your answer isn't correct, but it does show some real chess understanding and I would be happy with any student under 1900 that answered in this way. Explaining the Rating Spread: The key to this problem is the realiza­ tion that black's main pawn break is ... e6-e5. If you understood this, then you also understood that Bb2 would prove useful at some point in the game. The truth is that 8.Bb2 is very sensible (in fact, it's white's most popular move here). Yes, it does look like a Tall-Pawn on that square, and if Bb2 was simply a \"let me develop it somewhere\" kind of move, then it would be open to serious criticism. However, 8.Bb2 actually demonstrates a deep understanding of not only white's pos­ sibilities, but also the opponent's. Remember, you need to know the ideas for both sides. Thus, if Black doesn't want to suffocate due to his lack of space, he'll eventu­ ally have to play ... e6-e5 . When that happens, White will capture on e5 and turn the \"Tall-Pawn\" into a very fine piece. 8.Bb2 Bg7 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 Qc7 ll.Na4 Ne4 12.Nel (12 .Nd2 !?) 12...e5 (12 ...b5!?) 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.f3 Nf6 15.Nb6, V.

As we discussed in Part Five, Weak Pawns, when facing an isolated pawn you ideally want to: ....... control the square in front of the pawn so it can't move . ....... swap mmor p1eces . ....... end up with a Queen and Rook vs. Queen and Rook, which stamps the isolated pawn as a pure weakness. All this means that 14.Nh4 does indeed make sense since it forces the exchange of light-squared Bishops. However, just because you follow a basic rule doesn't mean that it will always be effective-rules are simply guidelines that make life easier for you, but they need to be weighed by each position's individual characteristics to determine just how good they really are. Explaining the Rating Spread: This tests your knowledge of the isolated d-pawn. One of main ways to combat it is to exchange minor pieces, thus depriving the pawn's owner of active minor pieces as compensation. If you understood that Nh4 was making use of this rule, then you did very well. 14.Nh4! Bxe2 14 ...

This would be true if he was allowed the time to play ... Be7 followed by ... 0-0. On the other hand, black's King is still in the center. This, combined with the weak­ ness of the b6 and c4 squares (Nc4 would immediately threaten Nb6), means that dynamic play is called for so he can make maximum use of these factors. Since Nc4 begs to be played, 12 .g4 is necessary since the immediate leap with the Knight (12 .Nc4) allows 12 ... Bxf3 13 .gxf3 Qf5 and Black is fine. Explaining the Rating Spread: If weakening your King by g4 made you a bit uncomfortable, good for you! You should feel a tad spooked when you play a move like that. On the other hand, g4 only makes sense if you realized that White was going to embrace dynamics (thanks to black's central King) and g4 was an important part of the dynamic philosophy (which called for a follow up of Nc4). Though 12 .g4 weakens white's kingside a bit (the f4-square in particular has \"hole­ like\" qualities), the advance of the g-pawn is the only way to allow his forces to leap into action and begin a fight while black's King still resides in the center. As always, it's important to decide if your position is dynamically or statically inclined. If the answer is dynamic, then you have to play with all the energy you can muster, often sacrificing material and/or allowing weaknesses for fluid, active possibilities. 12.g4!

However, this isn't the case and 29.Nd5 would be a serious mistake. Explaining the Rating Spread: If you noted the weakness of d6 and also saw that Nd5 led to a hole on c6 but one that wasn't useable, then you've passed this problem with flying colors! Problems with the black position: the weakness of the d5 -square, the vulnerability of the f5 -square, and the offside black Knight on h5. However, even more important than these things are the targets on b6 and d6. 29.Nd5 Nxd5 30.cxd5, though still better for White, covers up the weakness on d6. Simply put, when you see an enemy weakness, don't go out of your way to make it inaccessible!

Volkov, Smolensk 1991 White to move If the hole on e5 hit you in the face and made you long for complete domination of that square, then you possess a keen positional eye. Explaining the Rating Spread: You could only solve this if you noticed the hole on e5 and you wanted to make it your own. Since domination of e5 is your main goal (to be followed by pressure against the backward pawn on e6), you need to find a move that increases your control over that point. Furthermore, since black's Knight is the main defender of e5, it stands to reason that getting rid of that Knight will vastly increase your claim to the desired square. l.Bb5 Getting rid of this Knight takes the pressure off of d4, leaves e6 weak, and also permanently claims possession of the critical e5 -square. Once the Knight gets to live there, the superiority of the horse over the Bishop will be clear. l.. .Rac8 2.Racl The immediate 3 .Bxc6 might have been a bit more accurate. 2 ... a6 3.Bxc6 Bxc6 4.Qa3 and white's advantage is beyond dispute.

Black has a central pawn majority and two Bishops, but his King is still in the center. Of course, Black will have a playable position if he's able to castle, so White has to either prevent castling altogether or make Black pay a price to get his King to safety. Explaining the Rating Spread: Black's King is still in the center and you should demand something lasting if he manages to castle. In other words, you should have looked long and hard for a dynamic solution. White is able to make tactical use of his lead in development and black's vulnerable King. However, whether you noticed white's move or not, consider the problem solved if you came up with a similar breakdown to the one above. 14.Nc6! e5? Not a good idea.

In this case the passed pawn is on e6, which means the answer to our problem is e7! ��p_l_�ining tJte Rating �read: If you understood that white's e6-pawn was passed, then you should have also understood that laying claim to the square in front of it is often critical in such situations. The tripled pawns are almost a distraction from what's really going on: White has a passed e6-pawn and would love to push it. His light-squared Bishop is containing black's Rook, and it also controls the promotion square on e8. Thus it's up to White to make his passer count. To accomplish this, he needs to take control of the e7 -square so the pawn can advance. 23.Nd4 This not only protects e6, but it also prepares to fight for the e7-square with a well-timed Nf5. 23 ...

Black's pawn structure is aiming at the queenside (e7-d6-c5), and his most natural move is ... b7-b5 . However, White has prevented that move. Other typical ideas for Black are ... e7-e6 (trying to kick-start the e8-Rook) and ... f7-f5 ANSWERS TO TESTS 609 (though this move would weaken black's King position and also open the e-file for white's Rook). Explaining the Rating Spread: Moves aren't important here, but knowing what the structure expects from you is! If you were aware of all three major pawn breaks ( ... b7-b5 and/or ... e7-e6 for Black and e4-e5 for White) then you've passed this test with flying colors. Since White wants to play e4-e5, Taimanov's 18th move is easy to understand.

Is Chess a Gentleman'S. Game? Teaching Chess to Chlldre,u Instru In 2009 I was asked by the website chess.com to write a question-and-answer column for players ranging from complete beginners to titled players. Naturally, everything one could imagine was asked, ranging from opening theory to study habits to diet to whether or not a person was qualified to teach chess to children. Later, it occurred to me that some of my answers would nicely complement the chapters in this book, while others would embrace completely new (but highly useful) subjects. As a result, often-asked topics like \"How to create an opening repertoire\" will please those interested in opening study, while practical but rarely voiced questions like \"what to eat during a tournament\" and \"how to offer a draw\" should prove extremely interesting to a myriad of readers who often wondered about such things, but didn't know where to look for an answer. * * * * * Imbalances Tom asked: If I'm doing a tactical puzzle, should I be looking at the imbalances before I start cal­ culating? Or does this not apply when you know there's a tactical shot in the position? Dear Tom, Imbalances (space, material, pawn structure, weak squares, superior/inferior minor pieces, etc.) offer a player a firm grasp of what's happening in any given position. Instead of looking at a position and not knowing what in the world is going on, you can train yourself to quickly recognize any and all imbalances for both sides. Then, any move you consider will have something to do with the positive/negative features on the board. Most players simply calculate. For example, when looking at their position (as the clock ticks) they internally say, \"I go there and he goes there and I go there, etc.\" However, if I were to ask them at that exact moment to lecture me on the ins and outs of the position, they will usually be way off, or in many cases even clueless. How can you find a move that conforms to the needs of a position if you don't know what 614 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION Tactics are another matter. Having the ability to calculate deeply is a huge plus, but few can do it. In fact, though you can work on and improve your ability to calculate to some degree, possessing the ability to calculate deeply, quickly, and accurately (at a GM level) is a god given gift (don't mix this up with learning tactical patterns-it's relatively easy to vastly improve your tactical IQ by the study of each mating pattern, each basic tactical pattern [forks, pins, etc.] , and going over all sorts of tactical puzzles). I tend to place very high-level calculation under the umbrella of \"talent,\" while positional skills are something everyone can learn and excel at. Oddly, few players hone their positional skills, preferring to muddle through with a good tactical IQ and poor calculation. Sadly, many players that do have serious calculation mojo rely on that skill set while ignoring all the others (I've known several IMs that have grandmaster level tactical ability but 2300 positional skills). When looking over a \"find the tactic\" type problem, you can indeed just look for the tactical solution (since it's been announced that there is one). Be aware that almost all tactics are based on double attacks, undefended (or inadequately defended) pieces, and/or a vulnerable King-that will make it easier to find. However, in actual play no voice of authority says, \"Tom, there is a tactic here. Find the tactic Tom!\" Thus (in a real game), it's important to do that imbalance rundown so you know exactly what's going on in every position you reach, while also asking (after you do the imbalance thing) if there are any double attacks and/or undefended/ inadequately defended pieces, and if the enemy King appears vulnerable to a karate chop to the throat. In some situations you'll find that there is a tactic, but it gives you less than the correct positional move. Here's an example: Here's a line in the Semi-Slav that used to be fairly popular: l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 e6 4.e3 Nf6 5.Nf3 Nbd7 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.0-0 0-0 8.e4 and now 8 ... dxc4 is black's best move since 8 ... dxe4 9.Nxe4 Nxe4 IO.Bxe4 eS?? (10 ... h6, intending ll ...e5, is a bet­ ter try) ll .dxe5 Nxe5 12 .Nxe5 Bxe5 (Black has an undefended piece, so White finds a tactic based on that and a double attack) 13 .Bxh7+! Kxh7 14.Qh5+ Kg8 15.Qxe5 leaves White with a solid extra pawn and a huge plus. An almost identical position was often reached by l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 e6 4.e3 Nf6 5.Nf3 Nbd7 6.Bd3 Bb4 7.0-0 0-0 8.a3 Bd6 (it seems that White got a2-a3 in for free, why would Black allow this?) 9.e4 dxe4 10.Nxe4 Nxe4 ll .Bxe4 e5 and here, in the game G. Kasparov - R. Huebner, Brussels 1986, the great K played 12 .Bc2 Re8 APPENDIX I INST RU CTIVE AR TICLES 615 13.Re 1 exd4 14.RxeS+ QxeS 15 .Qxd4 Be7 16.Bg5 Bxg5 17.Nxg5 Nf6 1S.Rd 1 Be6 19.Re 1 QdS 20.Nxe6 fxe6 21.Qe3 KhS 22 .h3 Qd7 23 .g4 ReS 24.Qe5 QdS 25.Kg2 Qb6 26.Rd1 c5 27.Ba4 RfS 2S.Rd6 Qc7 29.Rxe6 Qf7 30.Qxc5 Nxg4 31 .QxfS+ QxfS 32 .hxg4, 1-0. White regains the Queen with ReS and ends up with an extra piece. At this point, astute readers will be asking, \"Wait a second! Did Kasparov really miss the same tactic from the previous example?\" Let's see if it still works: 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13 .Nxe5 ExeS 14.Bxh7+ Kxh7 15.Qh5+ KgS 16.Qxe5 with an extra pawn. Yep, the tactic does indeed work. Of course, Kasparov saw that he could do this, but was also aware that this position (after 16.Qxe5), though a bit better for White, is basi­ cally drawn!!! I can imagine that many of you are now shaking your head with pity. \"Silman must have hit his head again! The poor fool doesn't realize it's the same position.\" But, is it really the same position? There's one \"small\" difference: White's a-pawn is on a3 in the Kasparov game, and on a2 in the earlier position with 6 ... Bd6. In fact, players with Black often chose 6 ... Bb4 7.a3 Bd6 hoping to get this very same pawn down (drawn) position, while the pawn down position with the a-pawn on a2 is more or less lost. This still sounds like gibberish (thereby strengthening the concussion theory), but here's the rub: All the tactical skill in the world won't give you the answer, but a positionally trained eye will tell you that, with a2-a3 in, the b3-square is weakened and, after 16 ... Qd3 , White is forced to push his c-pawn (in the position with 6 ... Bd6 White would simply play 17.b3), thereby giving black's light-squared Bishop access to d5 (that, combined with the Bishops of opposite colors, makes it more or less im­ possible for White to win). Many games were drawn from this position. Here's one example: 17.c5 Be6 1S.Bf4 Bd5 19.Rfe 1 f6 20.Qh5 Bf7 21 .Qg4 RfeS 22 .h3 Qc4 and Black drew without too much difficulty in B. Larsen -A. Bisguier, San Juan 1969. You may see a number of tactics in various games, but is the pretty combination really the best way to play the position? If you don't have a grasp of the imbalances, you'll have no way to answer that question. Ultimately, high-level chess is a game that demands balance. Tactics without positional skills just won't hold up, while positional skills without tactics will also fall on its face. * * * * * 616 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDIT ION Help! I Need a Plan! IM David Pruess asked: I do know a few things about planning-! even teach \"how to plan\" to my own students sometimes. But I still come across positions fairly often, maybe one in ten games, where I feel I should have a plan, but can't come up with anything. Typically I get into time trouble in such games. Now, I believe there are games where you don't need a long-term plan, just a series of 2-3 move operations; but I have the distinct feeling that in these games I am thinking of there was a good plan to be had. I'm going to include the opening moves of this game, because they are kind of inter­ esting, and might help a tiny bit in orienting yourself to the position I am interested in: l.c4 e6 2.Nc3 d5 3.d4 c6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Qc2 Bd6 6.Nf3 Ne7 7.Bg5 f6 8.Bh4 Bf5 9.Qd2 0-0 10.Bg3 Be4 ll.e3 Bxf3 12.gxf3 f5 13 .Bxd6 Qxd6 14.f4 So first of all, my state of mind at this point: I was quite selbst-zufrieden, a little bit self-congratulatory about the success of my \"interesting idea\" of ... f6, ... Bf5-e4. I evaluated the position fairly optimistically based on these factors: I felt my posi­ tion had enough space, my pieces could all find decent squares, f5 and g7 could be defended by pieces so I would not have to push g6, and I had even inflicted a slight structural weakness on white that might eventually tell. I also thought that White had a little question to figure out with his King. If he castled queenside, I thought I might have the stronger attack when I advanced my pawns there, as the kingside seemed pretty static. If he castled kingside, maybe his pawn weaknesses there would allow me to lift my rooks via the third rank and gener­ ate some attack there too. However, over the next few moves, the psychological initiative swung back my opponent's way, as he made several pretty quick moves, and I began to burn up time, unable to come up with any plan. He left his king in the center, so I could not go for any direct attack. Now, often, I make a plan by picking a part of the board where I think I am stronger (or potentially stronger) than the opponent. This was not helpful here. Other times, I look at some piece of mine and ask: where would I put it ideally-in this position I had trouble doing that for my knights. Thanks in advance for any light you can shed on this for me! APPENDIX I INSTR UC TIVE ARTICLES 617 Dear Mr. Pruess, I think the vast majority of positions call for 2-3 move operations. Of course, this comes after you decide whether the position is static or dynamic in nature, and what the various imbalances for both sides are (a trained player does all that in seconds). Then you quickly decide what move(s) fit the needs of the position and analyze them and all tactics that arise from them. This is why, in my 4th Edition of How to Reassess Your Chess, I stress the need for every player to master the necessary (but simple) skill of recognizing imbalances over any particular thinking technique since that one thing gives you a firm handle on a position's nature and its needs. Having said that, there are times when a position calls for a far deeper plan or, on very rare occasions, even a \"grand plan.\" For example, in the following game (I'll use examples from my own practice since it saves me the trouble oflooking up other sources and I also know what I was thinking, which is very important in the context of this article.) I used a grand plan, which enabled me to pretty much \"see\" the way the game would go from move 18 to 38. D. Gliksman - J. Silman, Software Toolworks 1988 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Bh4+ 4.Nc3 c5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Bd3 Bxc3+ This is the Huebner Variation of the Nimzo-Indian, a line that instantly creates a Bishop versus Knight imbalance in the hope of proving that the upcoming pawn structure (made possible by the lack of flexibility of white's doubled pawns) will prove conducive to Knights. As you play through the game, you'll see just how important that Knight vs. Bishop battle was-it raged from the opening to the endgame. This in itself can be considered a rather basic plan, though others might think of it as a means of creating a long-term static plus. If the student learns to create this kind oflogical plan (which conforms to the dictates of the position), then he'll do very well for himself. 7.bxc3 d6 8.0-0 e5 A major part of Black's strategy-by closing the position he keeps the Bishops at bay. 9.Nd2 0-0 Black refuses to win a pawn by 9 ... cxd4 10.cxd4 exd4 ll .exd4 Nxd4 since after 12.Bb2 white's Bishops would be very strong on their wide open diagonals. lO.d5 Ne7 ll.f4 White is still trying to open up lines for his Bishops. In addition, Black must take the threat of 12.f5 (gaining a crushing advantage in space) very seriously. ll ...exf4 12.exf4 Again threatening 13 .f5, which would activate his dark-squared Bishop and squeeze Black to death due to his lack of territory. 12 ... Bf5! A tremendously important move! This simultaneously exchanges a pair of Bishops (depriving White of his Bishop pair) and stops the advance of White's f-pawn in its tracks. 618 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION 13.Qc2 Beginning a battle for the f5 -square. Less good is 13 .Bxf5 Nxf5 14.Nf3 h5 ! prevent­ ing a g2-g4 push and ensuring that f5 will remain in Black's hands. 13 ... Qd7 And not 13 ... Bxd3? 14.Qxd3 g6 (14 ...

Obvi­ ously, Black can't lose the fight for the f5 -square since that would also lose the battle of the minor pieces! 14.Ne4 This leads to a strategically lost position. However, White would also feel no joy after 14.Nf3 g6 15.Nh4 Bxd3 16.Qxd3 Qg4 (Forcing White to further damage his Bishop by bringing another pawn to a dark square.) 17.g3 Nf5 18.Nxf5 Qxf5 19.Qxf5 gxf5 when White's Bishop is absolutely horrible. 14 ...

My old note: A move with an obvious threat and a much deeper, hidden, purpose. If left alone, Black will surround White's c4-pawn by ... Nb6 followed by ... Qa4. White can prevent this and chase the Knight back by a2-a4-a5, but that brings White's a­ pawn into striking distance of Black's b-pawn, allowing an eventual ... b7-b6 advance which will lead to the creation of a winning passed a-pawn for Black. The rest of the game was already clear to me, I only had to work out individual tactics, never allowing White to veer the game off the positional path I had foreseen. 19.Rfel Nb6 The threat of ... Qa4 is very annoying for White, so he stops it in the only way possible. 20.a4 Rxel+ 2l.Bxel Re8 Also possible is 2l ...Nxa4 22.Qdl Nb6 23 .Rxa7 Nxc4, but I didn't see a need to give White any possible counterplay.

Black's next move prevents this. 46 ... Qb5, 0-1. So how did I see so far? Actually there was very little calculation. To me, the position seemed to \"absorb\" these ideas in a natural way and it seems all too natural for the path I created to be followed (that's not to say that a stronger op­ ponent wouldn't have veered off course!). When a \"grand plan\" is used, it usually means that: • The stronger side has a huge advantage and the defender is hard pressed to stop his opponent's intentions. • The strategic elements are so clearly defined that it would take a blind man not to see the potential long-term continuation right through to the end. When this occurs, it's up to the defending side to notice his opponent's intention and do everything he can to prevent it from going \"according to script.\" I got to play another grand plan against a very strong IM. This time the plan was more general, but just as effective. J. Silman - C. Lakdawala, California Chmp 1989 l.d4 g6 2.c4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.e4 Nc6 5.Be3 e5 6.d5 Nce7 7.c5 f5 8.cxd6 cxd6 9.Bh5+ Kf8 Usually White is delighted to exchange light-squared Bishops in KID structures.

In fact, often such a plan is almost devoid of calculation-it's completely made up of concepts based on the correct reading of the imbalances and the plusses and minuses in each respective position. As I said earlier, \"grand plans\" are rare, and usually one simply plays moves (Pruess' 2 to 3 move operations) that suit the particular position (again, based on the specific imbalances and on the position's dynamic or static needs). Here's a case of a dynamic, tactical situation: J. Polgar - J. Silman, New York 1988 l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.Bc4 Qb6 7.Nb3 e6 8.Be3 Qc7 9.f4 Be7 10.Qe2 0-0 11.0-0-0 a6 No deep plans here!

I could have played on, but the little girl Oudit was only two or three years old at this time) had attacked me with such ferocity that I was happy to have the whole thing over and done. And here's another example of a \"2 to 3 move operations\" plan-this time we'll look at a game that's completely positional: J. Silman - C.

As is so often the case, no calculation is necessary at this time (though you do calculate before playing every move to ensure that your artistic designs hold up to the cold truth of tactics). PLAN: Grab the b5-square with two hands, then chase away his best piece (the c5-Knight) by b4 (prep like b3, a3, and only then b4 might be necessary), then penetrate down the open c-file. Due to white's obvious advantage in space on the queenside, this should prove decisive. 15.Nb5 Ne8 16.Nec3 a4 17.Bc2 Ba6 18.b4 (Black is strategically lost) 18 ... axb3 19.axb3 Nc7 20.Nxc7 Qxc7 2l.Rfcl Rfc8 22.b4 Ne6 (Realizing that he would be toast after 22 ...

Qxd6 14.f4 Though many positions call for a quick set of moves, this isn't one of them! The basic details are easy to map out: • Black only has two pawn breaks: ... c6-c5 (a dynamic move that makes d4 and dS very weak ... however, it's his main break and is thus very important!) and ... g7-g5 (which won't be happening any time soon, but remains a very real possibility down the line a bit!). Black can also preface ... cS with ... b6 so that a capture on cS would allow ... bxcS. • Pawn advances for Black are ... a7-a5-a4-a3 and/or the advance of the b-pawn. But ... b7-b5 leaves cS and c6 weak-this might not matter, or it might have profound long-term static ramifications. • White's breaks are: b2-b4-b5 (minority attack, which I don't see happening in this exact position) and f2-f3 followed by e3-e4, which leads to all sorts of potentially catastrophic pawn weaknesses. Of course, f2-f3 without e3-e4 is also important since, though it weakens e3 , it also deprives the enemy Knights of e4 and g4. • Other factors: White has the half open g-file and can try and make his potentially weak h-pawn into a dynamic asset by h2-h4-h5-h6. • One other key question is: where to put the white King? ALL of this zips through my mind quickly as a result of training and retained pat­ terns from millions of games/structures. But in this case, it doesn't give me a clear answer! It seems simple, but it's actually a very tough position, and (in a real game situation) I would sit there and stare for ages, balancing all these considerations and trying to form a logical continuation/plan. Again: If you aren't armed with these elementary details, then it's impossible to play the position with any intelligence! If I was sitting at the board actually playing this position, other ideas would-in haphazard fashion-flit through my aged and rapidly decomposing brain: • If Black goes for queenside pawns on a4 and bS, then a2-a3 followed by Nc3-a2-b4 hits c6 and dS and prepares Nd3 with control over cS and eS. 624 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION This isn't necessarily bad for Black, but it's something he has to take into consideration. • If Black plays ... aS and ... bS, I can respond with a2-a4 ... b4 Ne2 hoping to bring my Knight to d3 or b3 and Rooks to the c-file so I can play whack-a-mole against c6 while also pressuring a5 and c5. • If White pushes his h-pawn down the board, Black will let it go to h6 (playing ... h6 himself leaves a hole on g6 that White might be able to utilize, it also makes defending f5 harder since ... g7-g6 is no longer \"on\") and then close up the g-file with ... g6-the pawn on h6 might really bother black's King later in the game, but also closes off the g-file and, in endgames, might become weak (or it might fix h7 and turn into a tower of strength!). • Black will likely try to push his a-pawn all the way down to a3. • If black's pawns get to a4 and b5 (with my pawn on a3), he will likely swing a Knight to c4. • Black might wish to leave his b-pawn on b 7, when there aren't any serious weaknesses in black's camp (the e5-square and placing a bit of pressure against f5 by Bd3 and Nc3-e2-g3 stand out). In that case, it will be hard for White to find an active plan. On the other hand, Black can only get active if he loosens his own position up. • If Black does leave his b-pawn on b 7, White has to be wary about the following scenario: (one with white's pawn on h6) Black plays ... Nf6 and ... Ne4. White trades, Black takes back with ... fxe4 and then swings his remaining Knight to fS. If White chops that Knight by Bg4xf5, Black will recapture with his Rook, perhaps double on the f-file, play ... Kh8, and then smash through with ... g6-g5. This series of moves, more than any other, strikes me (from white's point of view) as disturbing. This might compel me to take measures to avoid it by playing f2-f3 , stopping the whole ... Ne4 thing from ever happening. Again, I didn't do any actual calculation-instead I explored various pawn and piece configurations in an effort to deem what ones were most dangerous for both sides. It seems that Black has a slightly easier time leading the dance, though I consider things to be more or less equal. Anything could happen in this game! Here's a hypothetical series of moves: Black would most likely play 14 ... Nd7 when I (as White) would temporize a bit and push my h-pawn (since it's something I know I need to do): 15.h4 a5 16.h5 Nf6 17.f3 (Perhaps not necessary since the ... Ne4 plan, with an eye to a later ... g5 push, isn't effective if white's pawn hasn't gone to h6. On the other hand, I don't like Black dictating things, so I might go with 17 .f3 since it dominates his Knights) 17 ... a4 18.Bd3 when I would follow up with Rcl, Kf2 and ... it's just a game that offers mutual chances. * * * * * APPENDIX I INSTR UCTIVE ARTICLES 625 Two Questions on Planning E. ]. asked: I have a question that can get rid of some thorns in my mind if answered. What is a plan? I mean, how do I plan? Also, how do I know what plan is right for me? This whole \"plan thing\" among grandmasters is getting really confusing. Dear Mr. E. J. , Eliot, you're not alone! Many players haven't grasped the concept of planning. Quite simply, a plan is a way of taking advantage of the positive features (imbalances) in your position and the negative imbalances in the opponent's. For example, if the opponent has an isolated pawn on an open file, a logical plan would be to bring as many pieces as possible to bear on it. Double or even triple your heavy pieces on the open file. Let a Knight and Bishop join in on the destruction of that poor pawn. Remember: chess is a team effort and you want your whole army to work together towards a particular goal. You said something very interesting: \"How do I know what plan is right for me?\" The fact is, in most cases a plan isn't based on what's right for you. It's not a personal decision. A plan is something the board wants (even needs!) you to do. And it's up to you to learn to read the body language of the board and ascertain what the proper plan is. Thus, you might be the greatest tactical genius the world has ever seen, but if the right plan is to quietly take more space and squeeze him to death, then that's what you have to do. Abhilash_007 asked: How do you decide it's time to map a grand plan? Dear Abhilash_ 007, Grand plans are rare, even in grandmaster chess. To create them, you need to have a deep understanding of the given position's inherent tactics, structural needs, and the way both sides pieces can help/inhibit those needs. And you would only create one if you are positive that the basics of the position will remain unchanged for many, many moves. This tends to be very advanced, and I don't think that any amateur of any rating should be looking for grand plans. Appreciating them while going over an annotated game is one thing, but actually beating your head against a brick wall in the hope of creating one is quite another. One reason that a grand plan is rare is that the opponent can always do something that alters the tr3jectory of even the most logical train of thought. A chess position is always changing, and thus a grand plan rarely stays valid for too long (which means it was never a proper grand plan in the first place). In fact, some strong players don't believe that grand plans even exist-they view them as the creation of after-the-fact artistic license. Nevertheless, whether one believes in grand plans or not, long plans do appear from time to time, though the extent of what the player actually saw during the game and 626 H 0 W T 0 REA S S E S S Y 0 U R C H E S S - 4TH ED I TI 0 N said he saw afterward the game was over will never be known! Here's a classic example of such a plan, by none other than the 4th World Chess Champion: E. Znosko-Borovsky - A. Alekhine, Paris 1933 l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bh5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 d6 6.c3 Bd7 7.Rel Be7 8.d4 0-0 9.Nhd2 Be8 10.Bxc6 Bxc6 11.dxe5 dxe5 12.Nxe5 Bxe4 13.Nxe4 Qxd1 14.Nxf6+ gxf6 15.Rxdl fxe5 The following is what Alekhine had to say about this position (from the second book of his best games): \"The endgame position thus reached is by no means as easy to conduct-es­ pecially for the first player-as it looks. Black's plan of campaign-which will prove a complete success-is divided into the following parts: 1) Exchange of one pair of Rooks. 2) Bringing the King to e6 where he will be protected from a frontal attack by the e-pawn and be used to prevent the entrance of the remaining White Rook at d7. 3) By operating with the Rook on the open g-file and advancing the h-pawn, force the opening of the h-file. 4) After this the White King-and eventually also the Bishop-will be kept busy in order to prevent the intrusion of the Black Rook at hl or h2 . 5) In the meantime Black, by advancing his a- and b-pawns will sooner or later succeed in opening one file on the queenside. 6) At that moment the White King will still be on the other wing, the first player will not dispose of sufficient forces to prevent the final intrusion of the enemy's Rook on his first or second rank. Granted that if White had, from the beginning, realized that there actually existed a danger of losing this endgame, he probably would by extremely careful defense have saved it. But as it happened, Black played with a definite plan, and White only with the conviction that the game must be a draw. And the result was a very instructive series of typical stratagems much more useful for inexperienced players than the so-called 'brilliances.\"' The rest of the game seems a picture perfect replication of the plans Alekhine listed, but it must be admitted that White was most helpful in going along with the program: 16.Bh6 Rfd8 17.Kfl f5 18.Rxd8+ Rxd8 19.g3 Kf7 20.Be3 h5 2l .Ke2 APPENDIX I INSTR UCTIVE ARTICLES 627 Ke6 22.Rdl Rg8 23.£3 h4 24.Bf2 hxg3 25.hxg3 Rh8 26.Bgl Bd6 27.Kfl Rg8 28.Bf2 b5 29.h3 aS 30.Kg2 a4 31 .Rd2 axb3 32.axb3 Ra8 33.c4 RaJ 34.c5 Be7 35.Rb2 b4 36.g4 f4 37.Kfl Ral+ 38.Ke2 Rcl 39.Ra2 Rc3 40.Ra7 Kd7 41 .Rb7 Rxb3 42.Rb8 Rh2+ 43.Kfl b3 44.Kgl Kc6 45.Kfl Kd5 46.Rb7 e4 47.fxe4+ Kxe4 48.Rxc7 Kf3 49.Rxe7 Rx£2+ SO.Kel b2 51.Rb7 Rc2 52.c6 Kg3 (And not 52 ...

Ironically, this same Znosko-Borovsky is quoted as saying: \"It is not a move, even the best move, that you must seek, but a realizable plan.\" * * * * * The Art and Science of the Isolated d-Pawn Madhacker asked: I'd like to ask about the correct handling of positions where White has an isolated queen's pawn. The question was raised in my head by the following game I played in a local league match, against a significantly stronger opponent. Madhacker (1950) - Maria lgnacz (2200), Cardiff vs. Caerphilly l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.£3 (Is this okay?) 6 ... c5 7.Ne2 0-0 8.0-0 d5 9.Qc2 cxd4 10.exd4 dxc4 ll .Bxc4 Nc6 12.Rdl h6 13.d5 Bc5+ 14.Khl exd5 15.a3 Ne5 16.Bxd5 Nxd5 17.Nxd5 Bxd5 18.Nc3 Qh4 19.Nxd5 Rfd8 20.Ne3 Rxdl+ 21.Qxdl Rd8 22.Qe2 Nd3 23 .b4 N£2+ 24.Kgl Rdl+ 25.Nxdl Ng4+ 26.Kfl Nxh2 mate. My conclusion after the game was something like, \"I played d5 too early, if I had played a3 first and kicked the bishop away from b4, then played d5, it would have been much stronger because all her tactics involving ... Nb4 would have been taken away, and I would have had a good game.\" However, on examination by Fritz it turns out that this was not the case and I would have been at least slightly worse anyway. I understand that White should try to liquidate the IQP by playing d5, but I never seem to get it quite right. I'd like to be able to play these positions better, so is there any advice you could give me? Dear Madhacker, A very good question. Your problem is that you view the isolated d-pawn as a weak­ ness that needs to be swapped off by a quick d4-d5. However, though this pawn is a potential static weakness, it's also a dynamic tower of strength. If you are going to enter these kinds of positions, you need to adjust your mindset to the \"It's strong!\" view rather than your negative \"I have to trade the sucker off fast!\" association. In your game, 6.NB is the main line, but 6.8 (played way back in 1914) and even 6.Nge2 !? Bxg2 7.Rg1 are also fairly common. White (from a number of different openings!) usually gets the isolated d-pawn with a Knight on B. In that case, the d-pawn gives White control over the e5-square (his 628 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION f3-Knight will eventually hop there) and also gives White a central space advantage. These things, combined with moves such as Rfel and Bc2 followed by Qd3 give White serious chances of a kingside attack. And yes, the move d4-d5 is always on the table, but it tends to be part of white's attacking scheme and not, as you seem to imply, a try at trading and fighting for equality. Strategy for Both Sides In general, White wants to retain as much tension as possible, avoid minor piece exchanges, and either make use of his space or go directly for a kingside wipeout. Black needs to fix the d-pawn on d4 by controlling and occupying the d5-square. He has two basic ways to handle the position after this: • He can bring pressure to bear against d4 in an effort to tie White down to its defense. • He can seek soothing minor piece exchanges. This gets rid of all white's dynamic compensation and turns the pawn into a long-term static weakness. Black's ideal position is a Rook and Queen vs. a Rook and Queen (retaining the Queens prevents White from using his King to defend the pawn). Black will place a Rook on d5 (blocking the pawn) and put his Queen behind it-this leaves the d-pawn under enormous pressure, and often a pawn advance like ... c5 or ... e5 (whichever pawn he has) wins the pawn since the mutually doubled heavy pieces on either side of the d-pawn creates a pin. See the Silman - Filguth game (page 630) for an example of this. If things go bad for White (i.e., all the minor pieces are gone), he does best to exchange all the Rooks. Then the lone Queen vs. Queen situation will be drawable since a defending Queen on c3 or e3 won't be susceptible to pins on the d-file. First, let's look at a game with a structure that was similar to the one you got in your game: V. Korchnoi - A. Karpov, Baguio City World Chmp Match 1978 l.c4 Nf6 2.d4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 c5 5.Ne2 d5 6.a3 Bxc3+ 7.Nxc3 cxd4 8.exd4 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Nc6 10.Be3 0-0 11.0-0 h6 12.Qd3 Bh7 13.Rad1 h6 14.f3 Ne7 15.Bf2 Though White can't get a Knight to e5 like he does in most isolated d-pawn posi­ tions, he can still keep Black under pressure by retaining tension, avoiding minor piece exchanges, and aiming his guys at black's King. 15 ... Nfd5 16.Ba2 Nf4 17.Qd2 Nfg6 18.Bh1 Qd7 19.h4 Rfd8 20.h5 N£8 21.Bh4 f6 22.Ne4 Nd5 23 .g4 Rac8 24.Bg3 Ba6 25.Rfe 1 Rc6 26.Rcl Ne7 27.Rxc6 Qxc6 APPENDIX I INSTR UCTIVE AR TICLES 629 28.Ba2 Qd7 29.Nd6 Bb7 30.Nxb7 Qxb7 31.Qe3 and the two Bishop vs. two Knights battle is obviously good for White, but (after White missed a forced win) the game was eventually drawn in an exhausting 124 moves (and Black suffered every bit of the way)! As mentioned earlier, usually White has a Knight on B, which allows Ne5 and seri­ ous chances against the enemy King. This kingside attack has left countless victims laying in their own entrails over the years. Here are a few examples: M.

The isolated d-pawn is a common visitor for both White and Black. Here's an ex­ ample of Black accepting the isolated d-pawn for active piece play, only to fall victim to the anti-isolated pawn \"trade the minor pieces\" strategy. 630 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION J.

Mr. Madhacker, in future treat the isolated d-pawn as a hero (and avoid the trade of minor pieces!) and you'll be rewarded with many nice victories. * * * * * The Art of Stealing Opening Ideas A chess professional has to do many forms of chess preparation: If he's having trouble in endgames and technical positions, he has to do a detailed study of that phase of the game. If he finds that he often fails in sharp positions, he needs to do everything possible to iron out this flaw. And, of course, he also needs to go over all his games (especially losses) to see what he did well, and what he did poorly-once he figures out the poor part, it's back to the grindstone in an effort to fix all his chessic ills! Preparation is a never-ending part of a chess professional's life, but one area that always seems to be riddled with holes is a player's opening repertoire. No matter how 632 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N hard you work on it, new moves constantly crop up from all corners of the globe that challenge your favorite lines. Thus databases and magazines need to be carefully scru­ tinized so that you'll be forewarned about some hidden \"bomb\", thereby preventing it from crashing down on the board and turning your favorite opening system into mush. Since theory changes minute by minute on the world stage, a player's openings can never be as safe or as effective as he would like them to be. And, because memorizing a bunch of book lines just doesn't cut it, a real pro needs to fortify his systems with new moves and ideas, and new interpretations of old ideas. Since staying on top of the game is a 24/7 process, a true chess professional doesn't have much of a life outside the game. In fact, even if the hunky chess god manages to somehow score the attentions of a young lady for an evening, he'll be so obsessed with the millions of variations swirling around in his brain that, as her lips draw close to his, he'll be thinking, \"Damn, how do I answer Kasparov's new idea in the Sicilian? This is a nightmare! I must come up with something or I'm toast! And what about Anand's bust to my Philidor's Defense? I think Vishy did this to me on purpose! He's out to get me! But what can I do about it? What am I going to do?\" Yes, all chess professionals live in a permanent state of hysteria. And, while our dates might take that far away look in our eyes and the drool that's pouring from the side of our mouth as the first sign of infatuation or even love, they never guess that it is indeed love/devotion/passion-but for the game, not them. Since the opening workload is so enormous, and since the cutthroat world of chess is so overwhelming, every player (without exception!) has to fully embrace one of the most important and useful preparation strategies available: The art of stealing other player's ideas! This \"stealing\" comes in a few forms: • You pay other players to come up with new stuff, and they give it to you (with a signed statement that they will never use it-it's yours and only yours!). • You take other player's recommendations and make them your own. • You work with other players and, hopefully, they'll come up with some neat ideas that you can use before they do! I remember a situation in Toronto thirty-five years ago-a famous grandmaster was playing for first place in the final round but didn't know how to meet his opponent's ultra sharp system in the Sicilian. Since I was known to be an opening expert in those days, he asked if I had anything interesting against this system and, when I said yes, he offered to buy it from me. So, like a drug addict and his pusher doing their busi­ ness away from judgmental eyes, we consummated our unholy deal in the privacy of his room-I handed him several pages of analysis and he handed me cold, hard cash. Months later, thanks to the game he played, the line I sold him became all the rage and the pundits sang songs of praise about the grandmaster's creative genius. The most common way of finding a new scheme, system, or analysis is by looking for games with a strange new move-the stranger the better since most players will discount it as garbage. A serious look might convince you that it's actually quite good, APPENDIX I INSTRUCTIVE AR TIC LES 633 and after some work you'll be ready to unleash it against an unsuspecting opponent. The same holds true for game annotations like, \"Also interesting is 23.Nb5 !?\" The word interesting translates to, \"I just thought of this so I'll offer it as filler. Of course, I'm too lazy to see if it's actually any good, or even if it's playable.\" The well-trained chess pro's eye leaps at every \"also interesting\" note, and tries hard to ascertain whether or not it's legitimate. And finally we come to my favorite opening prep technique: working with another player and, if they show me some amazing new idea, playing it as quickly as possible and claiming it as my own! There's nothing like the look of fury on my analyst partner's face when I use an idea he's worked on for two years to beat a world class player in the last round for first place! After I collect my huge check, I always make a point of avoiding him for a few months until the memory of my \"crime\" fades. Then I'll call him from out of the blue and see what other ideas I can wring from his fertile mind. Here are a few examples of the \"stealing process\" from my own games: While sifting through a Chess Informant in 1980, I noticed the following game: E. Kuuskmaa - V. Salceanu, correspondence 1978 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.Bf4 a6 8.Nf3 b5 9.Qe2 Ra7 10.e5 Re7 1l.Be3 Ng4 12.Ne4 dxe5 13 .d6 Rd7 14.Bg5 f6 15.Nxf6+ Nxf6 16.Nxe5 Qa5+ 17.Bd2 Qa4 18.Nc4+ Re7 19.dxe7, 1-0. Is 9.Qe2 for real? My first thought was, \"9.Qe2 can't be good!\" Indeed, nobody else had played it after the Kuuskmaa game. Apparently everyone had the same impression I did-that 9.Qe2 was too primitive to work. Nevertheless, I began to analyze it and, to my amazement, I decided that 9.Qe2 was not only fully playable, it was extremely strong! So, after putting many weeks of analysis into this line of the Benoni, I decided to give it a go: J. Silman - G. Sanchez, San Jose 1981 This game was a last round contest for first place. A lot of money was at stake (at least, it was a lot of money for me at that time). My opponent was a very strong, solid master, so I decided to \"gift\" him with my little opening surprise. l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nc3 g6 7.Bf4 a6 8.e4 b5 9.Qe2 Bg4??

He didn't see it coming! 634 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION I continued to play Kuuskmaa's 9.Qe2 , though it seems I was the only player in the world to do so! Good news for me since it remained a surprise for a long time to come (information moved slowly in those days) and that meant lots of juicy points against a variety of grandmasters and international masters!

Looking in my database of several million games, I noticed that (other than the Kuuskmaa contest) the earliest game mentioned was V. McCambridge - E. Lobron, Dortmund 1982 ! That's right, Vince was so impressed by \"my\" 9. Qe2 that he stole it himself against grandmaster Lobron and scored a win! I'm sure people in Europe were saying, \"McCambridge's 9.Qe2 is pretty interesting! \" Indeed, after that game the move finally became popular. 1982 was a busy year for me, and I often analyzed with former U.S. Champion John Grefe. During one of our sessions, he showed me a new idea he had for White in the 4.B Nimzo-Indian. A few days later I found myself facing the very strong George Kane, and after l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 decided to \"steal\" Grefe's idea there and then! J. Silman - G. Kane, San Francisco 1982 l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.£3 Poor Mr. Kane was the unlucky recipient of a couple of my novelties.

At the time, this position was thought to be com­ fortable for Black, but I showed this assessment to be false after 14.Bb5 ! axb4 15 .Bxc6 Bxc6 16.Bxb4 Ne4 17.Rfcl Bxb4 18.Qxb4 when I had a clear advantage and scored a smooth win (part of that game appeared in Chess Informant). 4 ... c5 5.d5 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Nh5 7.g3 f5 8.e4 f4 This well-known position was considered to be quite nice for Black at that time, but Grefe's idea completely turned this assessment around.

Here's the rest without comment: 13 ... 0-0 14.g5 Ne8 15.Nf4 Qe5 16.Nd5 Qg3 + 17.Kf1 Nc6 18.Rh3 Qe5 19.Kg1 g6 20.f4 Qg7 2l.e5 d6 22.Nf6+ Nxf6 23.exf6 Qf7 24.Re3 Qc7 25.Bd5+ Kh8 26.Qe2 Bf5 27.Bd2 Rad8 28.Re1 h5 29.Re7 Rd7 30.Re8 Rd8 3l.Rxf8+ Rxf8 32.Qe8 Qd8 33.Bxc6 bxc6 34.Qxc6 Qd7 35.Qxd7 Bxd7 36.Re7 Bf5 37.Rxa7 Rb8 38.Ra6 Kg8 39.Rxd6 Ra8 40.Be3, 1-0. Imagine my surprise when I was reading the excellent Play The 4f3 Nimzo-Indian by Yakovich (2004) and noticed this same line (they hold off on ... Bxc3+ for an extra move, meaning ... f4 comes on move 7 instead of move 8-of course, it all transposes back into the exact same position) with this comment: \"Up to the end of the 1980s it was generally thought that 7 ... f4 promised Black a good game. However, Moskalenko's discovery 8.dxe6! gives White the advantage.\" What the hell? I go to the trouble of stealing this from Grefe only to have it stolen from me? Do the Russians have no shame? Even worse, they then give the following \"analysis\": 8 ... Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qf6 10.Ne2 fxg3 ll .Bg2 ! Qxe6 12 .hxg3 Nf6 13 .g4 0-0 14.g5 Ne8 15.Nf4 Qe5 16.Nd5 with a winning game for White. They didn't just steal 8.dxe6, they also stole my entire game! Oh chess, at times you just break my heart. In 1994 I was flitting around Eastern Europe playing in various events. While in Budapest, I spent time with English grandmaster (and chess writer extraordinaire) Peter Wells. Somehow we began talking about Kasparov and I brought up a little mystery: Why did Kasparov go into this line? Did he have something special prepared? Z. Ribli - G. Kasparov, Belfort 1988 l.N£3 g6 2.e4 c5 3.c4 Bg7 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 Nc6 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 Ng4 8.Qxg4 Nxd4 9.Qd1 e5 10.Nb5 0-0 ll .Qd2 Qe7 12.0-0-0 Nxb5 l3.cxb5, 1/z-1/z. It turns out that Wells had pondered the same thing and set out to discover what Kasparov's improvement was (Much later we discovered that Kasparov didn't have an improvement and entered the whole line more or less by mistake). Wells showed me a very inventive idea for Black, but for some reason he didn't seem to have that much faith in it. On the other hand, I continued to look at it and thought the whole line was 636 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION extremely interesting. Again, luck was on my side since I arrived at Kasparov's final position a few days later in a game against E. Anka (now a grandmaster). E. Anka - J.

I published an article on this opening variation in New In Chess Yearbook 3 3 and, in an effort to make poor Wells feel a bit better about me stealing his analysis, I made sure to give him full credit for its creation! Using other people's ideas is one thing, but claiming that you were the one that came up with them is quite another! * * * * * Creating a Study Program Mr. Svorcan asked: I am self-taught chess player. I have read a few books and have some chess software (Fritz, Chessmaster, etc). I play chess regularly on the net but my \"real\" rating is unknown, however on some websites I'm in the 1700 range. I play well against or­ dinary people that play for fun but have never studied chess. Anyhow, I can see that my game needs lots of improvement. Mastering the opening, planning, endgame, APPENDIX I INSTR UCTIVE AR TICLES 637 strategy, tactics, etc. I just don't know how to go about this-I feel that I'm jumping from one topic to another and leaping from one book to another without ever finishing anything. In other words there is no real order to my study and no real plan of study. What should I study first, and how long should I study it? At the moment I have the time and dedication to study chess, so I was hoping you could give me some advice. Dear Mr. Svorcan, I'm sure a lot of readers will identify with your question. And yes, it can easily be overwhelming! Some old time players (like Capablanca) recommended that you study the endgame first, but many are bored by endgames and he failed to tell the masses just what endgames should be studied. Others say tactics, tactics, tactics. Personally, I believe in balance (a bit of everything). In general, I would recommend that you keep things simple and only get one book for each area of study. For example, here's a possible program: Learn Basic Tactical Patterns There are quite a few great books on beginning tactics, but I would recommend that you get one that teaches the most basic themes. Here are two good choices (of course, every teacher will most likely have their favorites!): Winning Chess Tactics by Seirawan and Silman The Art of Attack in Chess by Vukovic (a classic!) Both books are great for anyone under 1400 (lots of very basic but critically impor­ tant material), while also being useful for players up to 2000 (both books also offer more challenging chapters as you work through them). There are at least a trillion books that feature tactical puzzles. Get a basic one and try to solve a problem or two (solve it from the book diagram) whenever you have a spare moment. This would be a nice complement to the two tactical theme books mentioned. Create a Basic Opening Rep��oi� FCO: Fundamental Chess Openings by Paul van der Sterren Modern Chess Openings (MCO) by Nick de Firmian I highly recommend FCO as your only opening book for anyone under 1400. It gives you the plans and ideas for every opening so you can decide which ones are to your taste. Once you're past 1400 (or ready to memorize some variations), another \"everything in one volume\" tome allows you to continue our \"keep it simple\" theme. Thus MCO is a good choice. Deeper opening study should occur once you have ironed out the deficiencies in the other phases of your game. When you reach that more advanced phase, you'll find a mind boggling amount of opening books which offer many hundreds of pages on every possible line. Positional Play I'll be shamelessly self-serving here: The Amateur's Mind by Silman (for players 1000 to 1600) How to Reassess Your Chess 4th Edition by Silman (for players 1400 to 21 00) 638 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION It's extremely important that the chess student creates a solid base of positional understanding that will work side by side with his tactical skills. So don't let anyone put down this critical phase of the game! �me Okay, here I go again (forgive me!): Silman s Complete Endgame Course If you're a beginner to 1900, that's all you will need. Chapters are based on rating groups. The nice thing about this book is that you should only read up to your group, or one past it. Then you can concentrate on the other areas of study (opening, tactic, positional chess). There are many fine endgame books that offer more advanced material. If you find that you love the endgame, don't hesitate to pick up more books on this subject-after you become fairly well rounded in all areas of chess study. In Search of a Chess Hero Looking over master games is always useful since one full game can give you insights into openings, the middlegame, and the endgame (the whole package!). By going over lots of games, you begin to pick up patterns that, over time, become engrained in your brain. The acquisition of chess patterns is the main ingredient for chess mastery. To make this fun, pick one player (Alekhine, Capablanca, Tal, Fischer, Kasparov, Karpov, Anand, etc.) and slowly go over their (annotated) games. Another possibil­ ity is a tournament book like New York 1924 (annotations by Alekhine). I love these things! You learn about chess history, you follow the event as if it was happening live, and you come to terms with which players bore you, and which ones really excite you-for example, Em. Lasker won NY 1924 and you might decide that he's the ultimate chess god. It's also possible to use a database to collect all the games of your chess hero. How­ ever, a database might not give you the quality annotations that you'd find in that New York 1924 tournament book or in a player's \"My best games of chess\" collection. Time Frames I would recommend that you start with basic tactical themes. Master pins, forks, various mating patterns and whatnot (you can do this in a couple weeks, but keep it up until you really feel you are familiar with that material) and then ... stop. Move on to the creation of an opening repertoire. Why change from opening to opening when you can put together a repertoire and learn from every disaster, every loss, and even every victory? Make sure you choose openings that suit your tastes. Thus, an all-gambit repertoire is great fun, while a positional repertoire would offer \"good times\" for another kind of player. FCO will make this \"what should I play\" process easy, fun, and quick. Once you have your tactical basics down and your opening repertoire primed and ready to launch, it's time to leap into a study of positional chess. This might take a few months, but it will prove invaluable. Don't hesitate to relax and solve various tactical puzzles during that time! APPENDIX I IN STRUCTIVE AR TI CLES 639 Finally, make sure your endgame IQ matches your rating. And, whenever you find yourself moving up the rating ladder, read more of that endgame book so your endgame skills are in accord with your overall strength. After you do all this (it could take anywhere from two months to three years, de­ pending on the amount of study time that's available for chess), start to look at master games and/or go deeper into the topics you already studied. * * * * * The Study of Master Games Ali K. asked: I followed your advice about studying master games and I already can see that my planning and transition from opening to middle game is much better now, and I can actually understand the reasons behind the opening moves I had previously played just by memorization. May I ask a few more questions about the study of master games? 1. Should I only study master games in the openings I usually play, or should I study other games too? 2. What's the best way to go over a game? I usually play the game on an actual board and try to understand the plan behind the moves, but I've seen others doing different things, like trying to guess the next move, or annotating the games, etc. 3. Which games do you think are the best to study? Those that are annotated move-by-move (like Neil McDonald's Art of Logical Thinking) or just important moves annotated (like normal games found in Magazines) or not annotated at all? 4. I've got ChessBase Mega Database 2007, and it contains many 2200 - 2300 games along with 2700-2800 games. Considering that I'm a 1700 player, should I study those lower rated games or should I only study the super grandmasters' games? Dear Mr. Ali K., Good questions! Actually, there's no correct way to go over master games. Looking at (and thus absorbing) patterns is instructive no matter how you look at the moves. However, lets discuss your queries in the order they were given: 1. \"Should I only study master games in the openings I usually play, or should I study other games too?\" When I was starting out, I would go over master games that featured my favorite openings if i was doing a study of a specific opening(s). On other occasions, I would look at all the games of a favorite player, or look at all the games from a specific tournament (which would feature all sorts of openings), or just start on page one of Chess Informant and go through everything in the book. In other words, no matter how you do it, it's good. One reason that you don't want to stick with games that only feature your openings is that you'll miss out on ideas and structures that usually don't occur in your chosen 640 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION systems, thus limiting your ultimate growth. On the other hand, if you are making a detailed study of some opening (let's say the Caro-Kann), then looking at 1,000 games that featured 1.e4 c6 is extremely useful since you'll see all the best setups, setups that don't work, correct middlegame plans, typical tactics, and also common endgames. 2. \"What's the best way to go over a game? I usually play the game on an actual board and try to understand the plan behind the moves, but I've seen others doing different things, like trying to guess the next move, or annotating the games, etc.\" If I want to absorb as much information as possible, as quickly as possible, from a large number of games (like the 1,000 games I mentioned in my answer to question one), I'll use a computer board in ChessBase so I can zip through a game in five to twenty seconds. Five seconds ifl realize it's complete rubbish, and twenty seconds if I decide that it's worth going over every move. If I find a game that I deem worthy of serious study (a new plan or move), I'll stick it in a special database reserved for games that need independent analysis. On the other hand, when IM John Donaldson drops by for a couple days to do some opening research, he's already picked out the key games from ChessBase. That leaves us free to do in-depth independent analysis, which we do on a nice board and set (with Fritz and/or Rybka humming away on a laptop next to us). Many younger players will only use a computer screen, but I prefer a real board and a nice wood set. It's strictly a matter of taste. If you wish to improve your powers of calculation (or see how positionally adept you are), then you should go over a game (with no notes showing) and do your best to figure out what's going on. Write down your thoughts for each move and also write down any variations that come to mind. Afterward, look at an annotated version of that game and see how close your own impressions were to reality. There are many reasons to go over master games, ranging from the assimilation of patterns to opening study to various forms of instruction to pure enjoyment. Each is valuable in its own way. 3. \"Which games do you think are the best to study? Those that are annotated move-by-move (such as Neil McDonald's Art of Logical Thinking) or just important moves annotated (like normal games found in magazines) or not annotated at all?\" It depends! If I'm simply trying to absorb patterns, I go with huge numbers of games with no notes. If I'm doing a deep exploration into a specific player's games, I much prefer to look at games annotated by that player (the more prose the better) so I can see what he was thinking about during each phase of the game. By the way, Neil's The Art of Logical Thinking is an excellent book! 4. \"I've got ChessBase Mega Database 2007, and it contains many 2200 - 2300 games along with 2700-2800 games. Considering that I'm a 1700 player, should I study those lower rated games or should I only study the super grandmasters' games?\" When researching openings, I don't consider games by players who are below 2 3 00 (FIDE) to be very valuable. And if I'm looking at games for enjoyment, or games that are theoretically interesting, I'll only go over grandmaster games or games by APPENDIX I INSTR UCTIVE ARTICLES 641 past greats (from 1800 to the present). However, when writing a book, I absolutely love using extremely old games, games played by beginners, on-line blitz games, and anything else that contains instructive content. In fact, games by lower rated play­ ers are often far more instructive than games by grandmasters. Why? Because the mistakes weak players make are the same mistakes my students (and most amateurs) make. Thus, these become a mirror into the student's soul, and the games and their lessons are simply more personal than any grandmaster game. In How to Reassess Your Chess, 4th Edition, I use lots of games from the 17th century to the present. And I also use copious amounts of games by players from 1100 on up. It's not unusual to see one example showing a battle between two 1400 players, the next a 400 year old struggle, and the next example a war between two 2700s played in 2009. If two earthworms played an instructive chess game, I'd make use of it! My goal is to teach, not to stick my nose in the air and proclaim that my upper-crust brain can only be fed moves blessed by grandmasters. Sadly, many players make the huge mistake of thinking that only top grandmaster games can teach them anything. While I agree that going over lower rated games in ChessBase is a waste of time, these same games (between low rated players) can turn into gold if a caring author deconstructs them into their highly instructive components. And let's be honest: though you might stare in wonder at a 20-move long grandmaster maneuver that leads to some obscure winning endgame, you won't really understand it because it's simply too advanced. But a 1200 player who misses a big chance to turn his Knight into a force of nature is something that can be readily understood, and it's something that will help make you a far stronger player. * * * * * Offering a Draw Doomclaw asked: When do you think is the right time to offer a draw? I have been confused by this question since I started learning about chess. Dear Doomclaw, An interesting question! There is actually a bit of etiquette related to draw offers. For example, one should only offer a draw when it's your move. Don't offer it when the opponent is thinking since that could distract him and thus be construed as a deliberate shady attempt. The proper way is to make your move and then offer the draw before pressing your clock. Once you offer the draw, then press the clock. At that point the opponent can accept it at any time before he makes his move and presses his own clock. Thus: 1) Make a move; 2) Offer a draw; 3) Punch your clock. Of course, you can offer a draw before you move (while your clock is running), but that puts you in a strange situation since a street-smart opponent will (or should) 642 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION say, \"Make your move and I'll consider it.\" This means that if you make a move that forces mate in two, he can shake your hand and accept a draw. However, if you hang your face, he'll say no and beat you. So for your own protection, think hard about your move, play what you feel is the best in the position, and only then make your offer, after which you can press your clock. It's also considered to be \"bad form\" if you offer a draw to a far stronger player. The idea is that if the superior player wanted a draw, he would ask you for it. So, if you are rated 1800 and are paired with a grandmaster, you really shouldn't make any offer-if you're winning, why chicken out and offer a draw? If it's equal, play chess and if the chess god you're facing wants a draw he'll offer it to you (trust me, he knows you want a draw-it's not a secret!). If you're worse and offer a draw to a far superior opponent, it amounts to an insult and a deliberate attempt to bother him. Perhaps you were hoping to go over the game with him afterwards. Making an insult offer like that will only ensure that he will refuse any attempts at a postmortem. In general, I tell my students to never offer a draw unless there's simply nothing left in the position, and to never accept a draw unless the board is devoid of play or if they are seriously worse. It doesn't matter if they are playing Kasparov, accepting a draw means they will miss out on an important learning experience. The fact is, a player that fights to the bitter end becomes feared, with even higher rated players knowing such an opponent has no respect for anyone and will take you to the brink each and every time he sits down. I remember hearing about a simultaneous exhibition given by Spassky (I think he was playing somewhere in the area of forty to fifty people). After about ten moves, one of Spassky's opponents offered a draw. Spassky, who was delighted, happily shook the guy's hand and said, \"Good game!\" Suddenly hysteria broke out! Everyone started offering draws and Spassky happily accepted-he was being well paid, and if these misguided individuals wanted to throw away a rare chance to play the World Champion (ten book moves isn't playing), then why should he care? He was just happy to have a quick night. Something similar occurred with Kasparov, who was giving a small clock simultane­ ous against a handful of the most talented young players in the U.S. One guy pounded out a few books moves and then forced a well-known repetition, thus getting a quick draw. Afterwards Kasparov criticized his opponent, telling him that this wasn't even a game, and that he might never get the chance to play Kasparov again. In other words, the guy threw away a huge learning experience (nobody will care when you say, \"Look, I played eight book moves and then shook hands with Karparov.\"). There are also quite a few draw-offer oddities. Here are three typical cases: • I saw one game where White offered Black a draw. Black thought about it for fifty minutes, leaving himself only twenty seconds on the clock. He then said, \"Okay, I accept!\" and reached out to shake hands. White replied, \"You accept what?\" Black: \"You offered a draw! \" White: \"I never offered a draw! \" Fortunately for the guy playing Black, I witnessed the very clear draw offer, APPEND IX I INS TRUCTIVE AR TICLES 643 and told the director that White was a scumbag. Black, of course, got his draw. • Decades ago, one famous grandmaster would often ask his opponents, \"Are you playing for a draw?\" If they replied, \"Yes, I accept your offer!\" he would say, \"Oh no! I didn't offer a draw, I just wanted to know if you were playing for one!\" • I've had many games where a far weaker opponent offered me several draws during a game. In one sense I don't mind this, since he's (in effect) offering me draw odds on top of the fact that I'm a higher rated player. In some cases I would push too hard to win against such an opponent, and, when I realized that I had committed suicide, I'd offer the draw. Then, without any thought, his hand would leap out and shake mine. Don't let this happen to you! Don't offer draws, and always play to beat anyone of any rating! * * * * * Proper Tournament Diet Unknown asked: What do you think is the best food to be eaten during a big tournament? Dear Unknown, Actually, this is quite an interesting question! Of course, people eat all sorts of gar­ bage before an event, but should that change during it? I think the answer depends on the individual. Do you have blood sugar problems? Do you find that you can't think as well after a large meal? Or, are you more or less the same no matter what you consume? Long ago, grandmaster Walter Browne used to insist that he would happily buy his opponent a huge steak dinner right before their game. Why? Because he felt all the blood would leave the brain and go to the stomach, making it impossible for the other guy to think clearly. Grandmaster Gligoric would eat chocolate throughout his games, while Fischer would sip apple juice. In the 1800s, top players would often bring a bottle of booze with them to the board and empty it during play. That doesn't happen anymore, but many grandmasters and international masters get completely drunk after a game-often staying out all night at the local bar and somehow appearing the next day fresh and strong. Of course, not all alcohol-loving players would drink after the game-there are many cases of titled players drinking before the game and appearing at the board in a state of near coma. In the 60s and early 70s, some players gave drugs a try during tournament games. In general, LSD didn't work out too well for them (an unnamed IM wasn't able to 644 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITION make even one move, sitting there watching dinosaurs fly through the air until his flag fell on move one). Others gave pot a try (in fact, many players used it before, during, and after play!), others speed, and others opium. Times were quite different then, especially when you consider that too much caffeine is now a FIDE offense, and if you're caught a couple times imbibing too many cups, you can be banned for a few years. That's quite a huge leap from the \"Exploration Uber Alles\" mentality of the 60s! Personally, I always had a serious sensitivity to sugar, and this more or less destroyed my career since I never made proper adjustments to the problem. In my youth, I would toss down chocolate bars during play, but would start falling asleep as the game progressed. I actually found myself waking up in several games with twenty to forty minutes having ticked off my clock! Later I would try juice, but even that level of sugar wiped me out and led to endless blunders as my brain melted and vision blurred. I only cured the problem in my final couple of tournament years-I brought a high-grade ginseng root to the board and sucked on it all through the game. Ultimately, you have to figure out what's right for your body. Knowing which foods and beverages work for you is extremely important. And, if you find coffee wakes you up and allows you to play at your usual level, or if cough syrup (banned by FIDE) is needed so you don't cough and disturb your opponent-go for it. Last I heard, coffee and over the counter cough syrup are legal in the real world-and personally, I would love it if my opponent glugged down forty cups of java. I can't understand why any chess organization has a say in such things. * * * * * Is Chess a Gentleman's Game? Anonymous asked: I thought chess was supposed to be a gentleman's game, but at times my opponents act rudely during tournament play. What can I do about this? Dear Anonymous, During a tournament in Los Angeles, two players got into a fight while playing and began stabbing each other with their pens. This is probably not a good way to deal with a rude opponent. In fact, the only correct thing to do when an unruly imbecile is sitting opposite you is to find the tournament director and ask him to put an end to your opponent's deplorable behavior before it escalates into something like the aforementioned duel. Rude and/or crazy behavior is a time-honored part of the game. The 16th Century Spanish priest and chess player Ruy Lopez de Segura recommended that, when playing outside, you should always face your opponent toward the sun so he will be unable to see the whole board through his permanent squint. APPENDIX I INSTRUCTIVE AR TICLES 645 I've personally faced players who covered the whole spectrum of bizarre behavior: one guy would whistle a song (his tone would get more dominating if he felt he was doing well, and it would taper off into a beaten, pathetic drone if he was losing), another would mumble, an old man made disgusting gagging sounds from the first move to the last, another old man kept saying, \"Go get the body! Go get the body!\" over and over, and one guy who appeared to have a bird's nest on his head kept picking at it, popping whatever he had gotten from the nest into his mouth. Here are a few more that I've faced, all of which are 100% true: • A famous IM used to empty one of those huge plastic coke bottles and fill it with tequila. He'd keep it on the table, ready for use in case of an \"emergency.\" His philosophy was, if something unpleasant happens on the board, take several deep glugs directly from the bottle and drink your worries away. He tried this on me once, emptied the bottle, and ended up with his face literally lying flat on the table. When it was his turn to move, his hand would rise up blindly, grope for a piece to move, and then (after pushing some piece somewhere) fall limply back to the ground. After he hung all his pieces, he quietly resigned and stumbled out of the hall. • I first experienced this one while playing a well-known chess politician. Mter I made a move that my esteemed opponent felt was annoying, he slowly took a sandwich out of his backpack, carefully unwrapped it, and then took huge, loud bites-chomping sickeningly as if he was a lion eating human flesh. Once the sandwich was consumed, he then made eye contact with me, smiled, calmly reached into his pocket, and took out some dental floss. Then he flossed away, bits of sandwich flying all over the board. • Many decades ago, I was teaching a fourteen-year-old girl who was all the rage. She did TV interviews, was big with celebrities, and was considered to be the next big chess thing by many pundits. While watching her play a tournament game, she hung a piece and, shockingly, quickly wrote a letter and handed it to her opponent under the table. It said, \"Please don't take my piece. My father will beat me if you do!\" • When things have gone badly and it's time to resign, some players have a final bit of fun by making use of creative ways to give up. Alekhine once threw his King across the room in disgust, while Nimzovich (against Saemisch) stood on the table (and by some accounts got down on his knees) and shouted, \"Gegen diesen Idioten muss ich verlieren!\"-\"Must I lose against these idiots!\" • Finally, while playing an event in London, an opponent of mine found a far calmer way to end the game-he simply pushed all the pieces off the board and onto my lap, and then got up and walked out of the tournament hall. * * * * * 646 HOW TO REASSESS YOUR CHESS - 4TH EDITIO N Teaching Chess to Children Rambaldi2 3 asked: I have a question regarding teaching chess. I'm very interested in giving students/ beginners private lessons and originally felt it most appropriate to wait until I achieve an expert rating, but I really have the urge to teach now. Right now I'm in the 1700s USCF and my rating is on an upward spiral. I feel I can certainly help beginners/ young kids with the basics, develop an opening repertoire, tactics, etc. In addition, I am a public school teacher by day so I have plenty of experience working with kids. My thinking is that once the student achieves a class C rating, the parent can decide if he/she should then study with someone higher rated. Do you feel it's appropriate for me to take on young students/beginners inter­ ested in entering tournament chess (or hobbyists), or am I correct that it's really not appropriate until I'm an expert? I value your input very much. There seems to be conflicting opinions on this. Dear Rambaldi2 3, Conflicting opinions? Well, there are always conflicting opinions among people that don't have a clue, so try to discount those that couldn't teach a dog to bark but love to speak, and strong players who love to put themselves on a pedestal. If you look at the various scholastic programs, you'll find that the vast majority of teachers are in the 1400 - 1700 range. And, that's perfect for kids (rating wise). When you want to teach children, there are a couple things that are far more im­ portant than a player's rating: • Do you have the patience to teach young children? • Are you a natural born teacher, able to communicate in a simple, clear, and entertaining fashion? • Do children feel comfortable around you? It's also important to understand one great truth: a high rating (expert, master, or even grandmaster) doesn't mean a person can successfully share his knowledge. It doesn't mean he can write. And it doesn't mean he can teach. Teaching calls for a specific skill-set, and teaching children calls for a skill-set all its own! I remember a gentleman in the San Francisco Bay Area who was \"only\" rated 1500, yet he taught chess for years at a junior college (he might still be at it!) and was widely respected as a very, very good teacher. Even players who were considerably higher rated than he was attended his classes. In fact, I attended one of his classes and was very impressed! So, your thought about having to be an Expert before you teach is simply wrong. Trust me when I say that you already have the goods: experience with children, ex­ perience with teaching, and a solid 1700 rating. And lest I forget, it also seems that you have a passion for it-a real desire to share your love of chess with young people. Sounds to me like you're a natural. Get out there and teach! And don't let anyone tell you differently! Books Best Games Alekhine, Alexander, My Best Games of Chess 1908 - 1937. New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1985.
