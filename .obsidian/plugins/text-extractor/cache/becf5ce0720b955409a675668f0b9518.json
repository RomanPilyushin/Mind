Seminal work in this field dates back to the 1990s, with early methods proposing to interpolate either between corresponding pixels from the input images, or between rays in space. Recent deep learning methods enabled tremendous improvements to the quality of the results, and brought renewed popularity to the field. The teaser above shows novel view synthesis from different recent methods. From left to right: Yoon et al. [1], Mildenhall et al. [2], Wiles et al. [3], and Choi et al. [4].
