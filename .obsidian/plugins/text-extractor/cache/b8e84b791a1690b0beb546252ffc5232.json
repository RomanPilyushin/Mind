TO WAIT FOR A CONDITION This book was typeset using the amazing LATEX typesetting system and the wonderful memoir book-making package. A heartfelt thank you to the legions of programmers who have contributed to this powerful tool over the many years of its development. All of the graphs and ﬁgures in the book were generated using a Python- based version of zplot, a simple and useful tool developed by R. Arpaci- Dusseau to generate graphs in PostScript. The zplot tool arose after many years of frustration with existing graphing tools such as gnuplot (which was limited) and ploticus (which was overly complex though admittedly quite awesome). As a result, R. A-D ﬁnally put his years of study of PostScript to good use and developed zplot.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
