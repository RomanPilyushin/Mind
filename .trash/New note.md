In the world of finance, particularly within the realm of options trading, "Theo" (sometimes referred to as "Mark" or "Mid") has a different meaning compared to casinos. Here, Theo refers to the **theoretical price** of an option contract, which is essentially the midpoint between the **bid** (highest price a buyer is willing to pay) and the **ask** (lowest price a seller is willing to accept) for the option.
