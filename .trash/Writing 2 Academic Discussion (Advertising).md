### Text

This is a challenging topic, but I think targeted advertising is an ethical problem and I [am] concern about it.
I strongly agree with Jessica’s idea that advertisers simply [not just] ignore our rights for privacy while tracking our activities on the websites.
I would add that advertisers also sell[s] our data to third-party companies.
While Mike raised the relevant point that companies could save money on the promotion revelant products to potential consumers, he didn’t mention that the same companies could just pocket that extra profit and do not offer better prices.
For example the profit from you will be used by shareholders for [in] their [thier] own interests.
