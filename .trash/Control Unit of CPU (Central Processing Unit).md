### Control Unit:

- **Function**: The Control Unit is responsible for directing the operation of the processor. It interprets instructions from memory, decodes them, and then signals the necessary operations to be performed by the other components of the CPU, including the ALU and registers.
- **Role**: It orchestrates the fetching, decoding, and execution of instructions by sending control signals to other parts of the CPU and coordinating the activities of the various units and registers.
