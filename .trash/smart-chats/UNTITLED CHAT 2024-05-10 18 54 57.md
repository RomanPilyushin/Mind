 Based on your notes, Theo refers to the theoretical price of an option contract, which is the midpoint between the bid and ask prices. It serves as a starting point for negotiation and reflects market sentiment. However, it doesn't account for all factors influencing the option's value and is a dynamic snapshot of the bid and ask prices. To get a more accurate valuation, it's essential to consider other factors and market dynamics.
