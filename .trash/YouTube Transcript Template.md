- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=0s) - Swiss money doesn't obey the rules. First of all, it's (beep) vertical. Most currencies like the dollar, euro and yen opt for a landscape design, but Switzerland is the exception from the humble 10 franc Bill to the elusive 1,000 franc note, Swiss cash towers over its contemporaries. In classical Swiss fashion, each bill is also overloaded with security features making the Swiss Franc one of the most difficult currencies in the world to counterfeit.
- [00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=34s) The design of the bills themselves is perhaps the most intriguing though. Unlike most other nations who choose to display portraits of influential politicians, monarchs, or founding figures, the Swiss Franc depicts hands? Why does Swiss money look so weird? Before we get into it, I'd like to talk about this video's sponsor, Aura.
- [00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=58s) Aura is your one-stop shop for online security. They can help put your mind at ease by removing your personal information from the databases of online data brokers. If you don't know what data brokers are, they're companies that legally collect and buy people's information and then sell, license or otherwise monetize it.
- [01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=75s) These data brokers can be in possession of and selling your personal address, full name and medical history to spammers, scammers, and really anyone willing to pay for it. If you don't have a service like Aura, then these data brokers are most likely selling your personal information too. If you do nothing, best case scenario is you get more spam.
- [01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=94s) Worst case is hackers can access this info and gain access to your accounts, for example, by using your date of birth or your address to bypass security questions. Aura protects your information by cleaning up this stray data and keeping your private info truly private. You also get a raft of other features from a fully fledged VPN to a dark web monitor that notifies you if your passwords are compromised to a password manager to make sure they're all unique and in one place to so much more.
- [02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=125s) The best part is you don't need 10 different products to protect yourself anymore. If you're looking for an easy way to stay safe online, then Aura is the solution for you. Go to aura.com/imperial in the link in the description or the pinned comment to try two weeks for free. That's all. Let's get back to the video.
- [02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=146s) The question of why they opted for verticality is a deceptively simple one to answer. It makes them easier to count and differentiate. Bank notes around the world typically grow proportionally larger at high denominations, making it difficult to assess at a glance how much money you're holding. Swiss cash, however, expands only vertically.
- [02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=170s) It does so because according to The New York Times' John Tagliabue, most people exchange money while standing and it is intuitively easier to hold and read a bill vertically while doing so. Solely restricting the growth of the notes to height provides a visually clearer spread of money, particularly when found out, and it also makes it easier for visually impaired people as their shapes are more distinctive and thus easier to sort through.
- [03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=199s) Additionally, the consistent width of each bill means that Swiss cash fits snugly into any wallet without certain larger denomination notes sticking out at the top. It is, of course, also just cool. No doubt a consideration in the design process was the unique silhouette and its ability to stand out on a global stage, and push a narrative of Swiss exceptionalism, a concept we'll return to later in the video.
- [03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=231s) When Switzerland first introduced its vertical currency in 1995, it became the first paper money ever to be designed on a computer, and its security features were seen as so advanced and numerous that according to The New York Times, it became a parlor game to try and spot the more than 20 anti-counterfeit measures integrated into the design.
- [04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=255s) Undoubtedly, Switzerland's newly acquired position as one of the world's leading financial centers incentivized the Swiss National Bank to depict the nation on the cutting-edge of monetary security. The franc provided an ideal, highly circulated canvas upon which to prove this. Optics aside, there were good reasons to future proof the Swiss Franc as it was at the time and still is regarded as a quote, safe haven currency.
- [04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI88&t=287s) The political and economic stability of Switzerland helped fend off currency volatility, and as a result, many foreign investors who sought to safeguard their wealth against inflation would often purchase large quantities of Swiss francs. Many would avoid storing their money in banks and instead opted to withdraw it and retain large quantities of physical bills.
- [05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=313s) The 1,000 franc bank notes were, as a result, highly sought after. Space efficient and highly valuable, one would not have to purchase a particularly large safe to squirrel away a veritable fortune. In that vein, in 1996, a staggering 77% of Switzerland's printed currency was actually held abroad by foreigners as a store of value.
- [05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=340s) However, it isn't just foreigners that covet Swiss cash. In Switzerland, bank notes were the most popular form of payment up until 2022 when the debit card finally dethroned them. Culturally, the Swiss prefer a great degree of control over their finances and are suspicious of credit. As a result, many tend towards paper money, no doubt due to the historical prominence of Protestantism in the country and the associated values of thrift and financial diligence.
- [06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=376s) Thus, the popularity of bills abroad and within Swiss society further increased the importance of their security, and in addition, their status as symbols of Switzerland. As far back as the early 20th century, Switzerland had been utilizing its currency, like many countries, as a vehicle to extol national values and propagate certain mythologies about the nation state.
- [06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=405s) In this 1938 500 franc bill, we can see a chemist in his laboratory exploring the frontiers of a nascent scientific field, and on this 1976 version of the 100 franc note is depicted the Ticino-born architect Francesco Borromini, with his design of the Baroque Sant'Ivo church in Rome. Finally, in this 1948 1,000 franc note, the veiled specter of death looms in the background of life, a lifeless child slumped over his bony forearm.
- [07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=442s) The latter design, morbid as it is, was meant to communicate that death is as much part of life as birth, an inevitability that must be accepted. This artistic spread was named the Dance Macabre. These early iterations of the Swiss Franc reflect traditions within the Swiss sociopolitical consciousness, the veneration of the sciences, of the arts, and in the case of the depiction of death's immutable influence on life, of philosophy.
- [08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=480s) It is no wonder then that the modern versions of the Swiss Franc share similar themes. The 1995 batch depicted influential Swiss figures, such as the architect Le Corbusier whose unique blend of intelligence and insanity led him to develop architectural monstrosities like the theoretical Plan Voisin, a scheme that would see 18 cross-shaped concrete apartment towers erected in the center of Paris.
- [08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=511s) The sculptor Alberto Giacometti, a famed contributor to the sphere of surrealism and someone who sought to dissect the essence of humanity through his works, also featured prominently, the gaunt skeletal frames of his metallic sculptures striding across the rear of the 100 franc bill. The most recent designs released from 2016 onwards forego portraits entirely, and instead focus on the theme cosmopolitan Switzerland expressed through hands.
- [09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=547s) They are far more conceptual than their predecessors. Each bill depicts, in order from lowest to highest denomination, organization, creativity, wealth of experiences, humanitarianism, scientific expertise, and finally, communication. These are idealized encapsulations of Switzerland, the way the alpine state wants to portray itself to the world.
- [09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=576s) I do have a think that it goes a little deeper than that, beyond a simple manifestation of cultural projection. It is my interpretation that these bills and the emission of portraits are a means through which to reinforce a tangible national character and that they are tokens of patriotism, nationalism, if you'd like to approach it cynically.
- [10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=602s) Switzerland, as the anthropologist Regina Bendix puts it, "Lacks any sort of heroes or martyrs to lift on pedestals as national icons," or in this case, print on the face of its bills. Even William Tell, Switzerland's most recognizable hero of folklore embodying Swiss liberty is tellingly relegated to one 25 franc coin minted in 1955.
- [10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=634s) Switzerland lacks a foundational conflict to motivate a strong sense of nationalism. The United States had the American Revolutionary War, France had the French Revolution, and the United Kingdom more recently had its resilience in the face of adversity during World War II. These events and conflicts and the key figures surrounding them are often depicted on currency in their respective countries because they are identifiable symbols of unity.
- [11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=666s) Most countries on the African continent can draw some of their unity from a collective struggle against colonial rule and discrimination. It is why South Africa's rand immortalizes Nelson Mandela, why the Algerian dinar commemorates leaders of the Algerian independence movement. What Switzerland does have, however, is an underlying mythos of exceptionalism.
- [11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=691s) Unlike most nations in Europe, and indeed the world, Switzerland was not formed by the swing of a sword, but by the stroke of a pen. Its earliest iteration in 1291 was formed diplomatically in order to fend off larger and more powerful neighbors. Even the 1847 Civil War, which led to the establishment of the Swiss federal state was less a cataclysmic paradigm shift and more a speed bump, a mercifully brief bloodletting that proved the exception to Swiss history.
- [12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=726s) The cantons of Switzerland were, for the majority of history, not economic heavyweights. They were on the fringes of European commerce with the Alps obstructing many trade routes. They lacked raw resources and were completely landlocked. This, in addition to being political outsiders, preferring republicanism over monarchism.
- [12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=749s) In these conditions, the Swiss state had to work hard to differentiate itself to survive, developing a tradition of neutrality, establishing specialized handicraft industries, a unique democratic system, and shining in the field of science, art, and philosophy. It is this mythos upon which the modern Swiss franc draws its iconography in place of a monarch, a precedent or a revolutionary leader of which Switzerland has no truly influential substitute are depicted these encapsulations of Swiss exceptionalism, of unique ideals
- [13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=785s) that supposedly helped propel average old Switzerland to prosperity. Switzerland is also a state of diverse cultures and languages, and as a result, no single individual or event can fully embody the nation on a bank note. Thus, the currency turns to the idea of Switzerland with all of its exaggerations and embellishments and indeed the typically uncritical myopia of narratives of nationhood.
- [13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=814s) I think this is also why the euro, for example, lacks portraits on its bills because for a geopolitical entity as diverse linguistically and culturally as the European Union, any one person cannot possibly be representative of the whole bloc. It is better to invoke an idealized aspirational version of the state when attempting to represent it on currency.
- [14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=840s) Switzerland has taken that line of thinking and run with it. Swiss money is adorned with scientific imagery, beautiful vistas dotted with mountain ranges, abstractions of artistic endeavor and allusions to neutrality. Previous designs of the Swiss franc did include people, but I think they too were meant to represent Switzerland's ideals rather than themselves act as national figures.
- [14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=866s) They were conduits to exemplify Swiss exceptionalism, all of them creatives and scientists, not generals, political leaders or revolutionaries, just regular individuals with exceptional skills, which if you think about it is about as close to a human manifestation of the mythos of Switzerland as you can get.
- [14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=889s) Benedict Anderson notes in his book "Imagined Communities" that Switzerland's status as a multi-ethnic state guided it in remaining neutral with its neighbors whose linguistic offshoots resided there, Italians in Ticino, French in Geneva, Germans in Schweiz. However, this atomization of the nation also seen in a lack of a common religion and its relative economic backwardness meant that a coherent Swiss nationalism did not appear until around 1891.
- [15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=923s) By this point, many other nations had codified national characters through linguistic or ethnic homogeneity. Switzerland had not, but since it was a late comer, it was instead able to construct a modern nationalism, a vision of the nation, not based off of heroes or martyrs associated with the dominant ethnic class or shared past glories, but of ideals that bridge linguistic and ethnic chasms, organization, creativity, wealth of experiences, humanitarianism, scientific expertise and communication.
- [16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=960s) In the words of Anderson, "Modernity rather than antiquity characterizes Swiss nationalism." The original designer of the vertical Swiss franc, Jorg Zintzmeyer, said, "The bank note is a medium by which the identity of a nation comes to the fore." Staying true to this sentiment, the Swiss Franc in its design tries to codify this imagined, idealized community in which Switzerland and its people are exceptional.
- [16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdW63lP-yI888&t=993s) The mythos argues they succeeded in spite of the historical hand that they were dealt because of their pursuit of progress and innovation over all else, motifs we have seen repeated in different eras of Swiss currency. Swiss money looks weird because it's more than just a means of payment. It is also a means of constructing the idea of the Swiss nation.
