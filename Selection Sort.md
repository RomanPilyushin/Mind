### Overview

Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited

### Explanation

1. Keep track the minimum value of each iteration
Each iteration update and swap elements

2. Open each box and check value inside

3. 9 is the first lowest number, write down this
9 is a new minimum


![[Selection Sort-2.png]]

4. Now we open the next box and 1 is new minimum

5. Open next all boxes but 1 is still be our minimum

6. Then we need move 1 to the first place of our array
Save 9 in our temp storage and swap 1 and 9

7. The first iteration is done

8. Move to iteration 2 and clear min and temp

9. Start from the new beginning

10. Iterate the list and store in our min 9 then 8 then 2
And after we check every numbers include 5
Our minimun is still 2

11. Swap the second element with minimum
Now is 9 (the second) and 2 (minimum)

12. The second iteration is done.

### Big O


| Case                     | Performance |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Worst case performance   | O(n^2)      |
| Best case performance    | O(n^2)      |
| Average case performance | O(n^2)      |
| Auxiliary Space          | O(1)        |


### Code


```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void selectionSort(vector <int> &v, int n) {
	int minPosition, aux;

	for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
		minPosition = i; // suppose "i" is the minimum

		// find the "min" element in the unsorted part
		for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) { /
			
			if (v[j] < v[minPosition]) { 
				minPosition = j;
			}
		}
		//  swap the found "min" element to the sorted part
		if (minPosition > i) { 
			swap(v[minPosition], v[i]);
		}
	}

}

```
