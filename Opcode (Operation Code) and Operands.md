![[Opcode (Operation Code) and Operands.png]]


In computer architecture, an **opcode** (short for **operation code**) and **operands** are key components of a machine instruction, which the CPU executes as part of a program.

### Opcode (Operation Code):

- **Definition**: The opcode is a part of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed by the CPU. It tells the CPU what action to carry out, such as addition, subtraction, moving data from one location to another, or performing a logical operation like AND or OR.
- **Example**: In the binary instruction `011010010010`, the first few bits (e.g., `0110` as shown in the image) could represent an opcode that the CPU decodes to determine the operation to be executed.

### Operands:

- **Definition**: Operands are the data items on which the CPU performs the operation specified by the opcode. These can be values, memory addresses, or [[Components of CPU (Central Processing Unit)|registers]].
- **Role**: Operands are the inputs for the operation specified by the opcode. For example, in an addition operation, the operands would be the numbers that need to be added together.
- **Example**: In the binary instruction `011010010010`, the remaining bits after the opcode (`10010010` in the image) could represent the operand(s) on which the operation should be performed.

### How They Work Together:

- When the CPU fetches an instruction from memory, it first decodes the opcode to determine which operation to perform.
- Then, it retrieves the operands, if any, that are required for the operation.
- Finally, the CPU executes the operation using the operands and produces the result.

In assembly language, an instruction might look like this: `ADD R1, R2`, where `ADD` is the opcode that tells the CPU to perform addition, and `R1` and `R2` are the operands representing the [[Components of CPU (Central Processing Unit)|registers]] that contain the data to be added.

### Summary:

- **Opcode**: Specifies the operation to be performed.
- **Operands**: The data or references to the data on which the operation is performed.

These concepts are fundamental to how a CPU executes programs, processing data according to the sequence of instructions provided.
