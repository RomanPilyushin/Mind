 Based on your notes, Theo refers to the theoretical price of an option contract, calculated as the average of the bid and ask prices. It serves as a starting point for negotiation, reflects market sentiment, and can be used in certain trading strategies. However, it has limitations as it doesn't account for all factors influencing the option's value and is a dynamic snapshot of the market.
