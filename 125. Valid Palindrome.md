### Problem

A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` _if it is a **palindrome**, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

### Input Output

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "race a car"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = " "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.


### Solution


1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
    
    - **Left Pointer (`left`)**: Starts at the beginning of the string.
    - **Right Pointer (`right`)**: Starts at the end of the string.
    - These pointers move towards each other.
2. **Skipping Non-Alphanumeric Characters**:
    
    - Both pointers skip non-alphanumeric characters by checking `std::isalnum`.
    - If a character is not alphanumeric, the pointer is moved until a valid character is found.
3. **Case Insensitivity**:
    
    - Convert both characters to lowercase using `std::tolower` before comparing them to handle case insensitivity.
4. **Comparison**:
    
    - If at any point the characters pointed by `left` and `right` are not equal, the string is not a palindrome, and the function returns `false`.
    - If the loop completes without finding unequal characters, the string is a palindrome, and the function returns `true`.
5. **Edge Cases**:
    
    - An empty string or a string with only non-alphanumeric characters is considered a palindrome.

### Test Cases:

- **Example 1**: `"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"` -> **Output**: `true`
- **Example 2**: `"race a car"` -> **Output**: `false`
- **Example 3**: `" "` -> **Output**: `true`

### Summary:

This solution efficiently determines whether a string is a palindrome by ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and comparing characters case-insensitively using the two-pointer technique. The time complexity is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the string, making it very efficient for this task.
