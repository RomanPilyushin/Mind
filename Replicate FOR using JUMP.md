To replicate a **FOR loop** in assembly language using just a **JUMP** instruction, you'll need to manually manage the loop control, incrementing a counter and checking conditions before deciding to jump back to the beginning of the loop or proceed to the next instruction.

Let's break down the pseudocode you provided into assembly-like instructions:


```pseudo
num = 1

FOR i = 1 to 10
    num = num + i
NEXT i

```


### Assembly Approach:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    
    - Set `num` to 1.
    - Set `i` to 1 (the loop counter).
2. **Loop Start**:
    
    - Compare `i` with 10 (the loop end condition).
    - If `i` is greater than 10, jump to the end of the loop (terminate the loop).
    - Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
3. **Loop Body**:
    
    - Add `i` to `num`.
    - Increment `i` by 1.
4. **Jump to Loop Start**:
    
    - Unconditionally jump back to the beginning of the loop to check the loop condition again.
5. **End of Loop**:
    
    - Execution continues after the loop if `i` is greater than 10.

### Assembly-like Pseudocode:

Assume we have a simplified instruction set:

- `LOAD R1, num` ; Load `num` into register R1
- `LOAD R2, i` ; Load `i` into register R2
- `CMP R2, #10` ; Compare R2 with 10
- `JGT END_LOOP` ; Jump to END_LOOP if R2 > 10
- `ADD R1, R2` ; R1 = R1 + R2 (num = num + i)
- `ADD R2, #1` ; R2 = R2 + 1 (i++)
- `JMP LOOP_START` ; Jump back to the start of the loop
- `END_LOOP:` ; End of loop

### Example Binary Encoding:

Hereâ€™s how we could potentially encode these instructions in binary (note: actual encoding depends on the architecture and instruction set):

- `LOAD` instruction could be `0001`
- `ADD` instruction could be `0010`
- `CMP` instruction could be `0011`
- `JMP` instruction could be `0100`
- `JGT` instruction could be `0101`

So the sequence could look something like:

```yaml
0001 0001 0000 0001  ; LOAD R1, num
0001 0010 0000 0001  ; LOAD R2, i
0011 0010 1010 0000  ; CMP R2, #10
0101 0110 0000 0000  ; JGT END_LOOP
0010 0001 0010 0000  ; ADD R1, R2
0010 0010 0001 0001  ; ADD R2, #1
0100 0000 0000 0001  ; JMP LOOP_START
0110 0000 0000 0000  ; END_LOOP
```


### Addressing Modes:

- **Immediate Addressing**: Used for comparing `i` with the constant `10`.
- **Register Addressing**: Used to store and manipulate values in the [[Components of CPU (Central Processing Unit)|registers]].

### Explanation:

- The `CMP` instruction compares the loop counter `i` against 10.
- The `JGT` (Jump if Greater Than) checks if `i` has exceeded 10; if so, it exits the loop.
- If `i` is still within the range, the program continues to add `i` to `num` and then increments `i`.
- The unconditional `JMP` instruction at the end of the loop brings the program back to the beginning of the loop, where `i` is checked again.

This method effectively simulates a FOR loop in assembly using jumps and conditional checks. The actual binary encoding and instruction names would depend on the specific [[Components of CPU (Central Processing Unit)|CPU]] architecture you're working with.

### Summary:

This approach allows you to replicate high-level loops in assembly language by manually handling the loop initialization, condition checking, and increments, using jump instructions to control the flow of execution. This is a common pattern in assembly programming, where control structures must be constructed manually.
