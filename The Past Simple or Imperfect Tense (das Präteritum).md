### Introduction


The Past Simple or Imperfect Tense, known as _das Präteritum_ in German, is primarily used in written language, especially in literature, reports, and formal writing. It's used to describe actions or events that happened in the past and are now completed. Unlike *[[The Present Perfect Tense (das Perfekt)|das Perfekt]]* (the [[The Present Perfect Tense (das Perfekt)|present perfect]] tense), which is more commonly used in spoken German, _das Präteritum_ is preferred in written narratives.



### Formation of _das Präteritum_

The formation of _das Präteritum_ depends on whether the verb is regular (weak), irregular (strong), or mixed.


#### 1. **Regular (Weak) Verbs**

For regular verbs, _das Präteritum_ is formed by adding the following endings to the verb stem:

**Endings for Regular Verbs:**

- **ich**: _-te_
- **du**: _-test_
- **er/sie/es**: _-te_
- **wir**: _-ten_
- **ihr**: _-tet_
- **sie/Sie**: _-ten_

**Example with the verb _spielen_ (to play):**

- **ich spielte** (I played)
- **du spieltest** (you played - informal singular)
- **er/sie/es spielte** (he/she/it played)
- **wir spielten** (we played)
- **ihr spieltet** (you all played - informal plural)
- **sie/Sie spielten** (they/you played - formal singular and plural)



#### 2. **Irregular (Strong) Verbs**

Irregular verbs often involve a vowel change in the stem and have their own specific endings. The endings are typically the same as those for regular verbs, but without the _-te_ in the singular forms.

**Endings for Irregular Verbs:**

- **ich**: (no ending or _-te_)
- **du**: _-st_
- **er/sie/es**: (no ending or _-te_)
- **wir**: _-en_
- **ihr**: _-t_
- **sie/Sie**: _-en_

**Example with the verb _sehen_ (to see):**

- **ich sah** (I saw)
- **du sahst** (you saw - informal singular)
- **er/sie/es sah** (he/she/it saw)
- **wir sahen** (we saw)
- **ihr saht** (you all saw - informal plural)
- **sie/Sie sahen** (they/you saw - formal singular and plural)



#### 3. **Mixed Verbs**

Mixed verbs combine characteristics of both regular and irregular verbs. They undergo a vowel change like irregular verbs but take the regular _-te_ endings.

**Example with the verb _bringen_ (to bring):**

- **ich brachte** (I brought)
- **du brachtest** (you brought - informal singular)
- **er/sie/es brachte** (he/she/it brought)
- **wir brachten** (we brought)
- **ihr brachtet** (you all brought - informal plural)
- **sie/Sie brachten** (they/you brought - formal singular and plural)




### Usage of _das Präteritum_

_Das Präteritum_ is used in several contexts:

1. **Narrative past**: It's the standard tense for storytelling in written German, such as in novels, fairy tales, and reports.
    
    - _Er ging in den Wald und fand einen Schatz._ (He went into the forest and found a treasure.)
2. **Formal writing**: Reports, newspaper articles, and historical accounts often use _das Präteritum_.
    
    - _Die Firma produzierte im letzten Jahr 1.000 Autos._ (The company produced 1,000 cars last year.)
3. **Certain auxiliary verbs and modals**: In both spoken and written German, _sein_ (to be), _haben_ (to have), and modal verbs like _können_ (can), _wollen_ (want), etc., often appear in the _Präteritum_ tense.
    
    - _Ich war müde._ (I was tired.)
    - _Er konnte nicht kommen._ (He couldn’t come.)



### Example Sentences in _das Präteritum_:

- **Regular Verb**: _Ich lernte Deutsch._ (I learned German.)
- **Irregular Verb**: _Sie schrieb einen Brief._ (She wrote a letter.)
- **Mixed Verb**: _Wir dachten darüber nach._ (We thought about it.)


### Comparison with _[[The Present Perfect Tense (das Perfekt)|das Perfekt]]_:

- In spoken German, especially in the southern regions, _[[The Present Perfect Tense (das Perfekt)|das Perfekt]]_ is used more frequently for past actions.
- In written German, _das Präteritum_ is preferred for the same actions.

In summary, _das Präteritum_ is essential for storytelling and formal writing in German. While it might not be as common in everyday conversation, mastering it is important for understanding and creating written narratives.

#### The Simple Past Tense in English

The simple past describes an event within a time frame that is completed (compare the simple past "I cooked twice this week" with the [[[The Present Perfect Tense (das Perfekt)|present perfect]],](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Perfect/Perfect.html) "I have cooked twice this week" — the former implies that that's all the cooking I'm going to do, while the latter leaves open the possibility that I might cook more).


English forms this tense in several ways:

Weak verbs add _-ed_: "looked," "wanted," "worked," etc.

Strong, or irregular, verbs generally change the vowel in the stressed syllable. A variety of other changes are possible, as well: "ate," "sang," "held," "went," "thought," etc.


#### The Simple Past Tense in German


In German, as in English, the simple past differs from the [[[The Present Perfect Tense (das Perfekt)|present perfect]],](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Perfect/Perfect.html) in that it describes past events that are interrelated within a time frame that is separate from the present. Hence it is typically used in narratives. German speakers are not always careful in making this distinction. Indeed, they sometimes even mix the two tenses indiscriminately.

#### Weak erbs


**Weak verbs** form the simple past by adding _-(e)te_, _-(e)test_, _-(e)ten_, or _-(e)tet_ to the stem:

| Wir machten die Tür zu. | We closed the door.     |
| Du kauftest zu viel.    | You bought too much.    |

#### Irregular weak verbs


**The [irregular weak verbs,](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Verbs/StrongVerbs.html#sollen) including the [modal auxiliaries](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Verbs/modals.html)**[,](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Verbs/modals.html) add these same endings to a (usually) changed stem:


| Ich wollte das hören.         | I wanted to hear that.          |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Wir durften das nicht sagen.  | We weren't allowed to say that. |

#### Strong verbs


The remaining [**strong verbs**](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Verbs/StrongVerbs.html) (usually) change the stem and add either no ending or _-st_, _-en_, or _-t_:


| Ich ging nach Hause.          | I went home.             |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Wir sahen ihn nicht.          | We didn't see him.       |
| Du sprachst zu schnell.       | You spoke too fast.      |
| Ihr halft uns nicht.          | Y'all didn't help us.    |
| Sie schliefen lang.           | They slept late.         |
| Sie las das Buch.             | She read the book.       |
| Sie schrieben es auf Deutsch. | They wrote it in German. |


These irregular forms fall into distinct categories. Here is a list of the most common [strong verbs,](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Verbs/StrongVerbs.html) arranged in those groups.

*Erich Romann lived here until 1935, when, under pressure from the Nazi regime, he took his own life*


#### Distinctions between the Simple Past and the [[The Present Perfect Tense (das Perfekt)|Present Perfect]]


In spoken German, the simple past is perceived as formal. Colloquial narratives often use the [[[The Present Perfect Tense (das Perfekt)|present perfect]] tense:](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Perfect/Perfect.html) "Ich bin nach Hause gegangen und habe meinem Mann gesagt...." 

Indeed, many dialects do not have a simple past. The simple past is reserved for more formal narratives; novels are one example.

In ordinary conversation, then, the simple past is unusual. There are however, a few exceptions, primarily the verbs "sein," "haben," and the [modal auxiliaries](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Verbs/modals.html). It is quite common to say: "ich war da", instead of "ich bin da gewesen"; "wir hatten eine Katze", instead of "wir haben eine Katze gehabt"; or "sie konnte ihn sehen", rather than "sie hat ihn sehen können." This is particularly true when it serves to cut down on complexity. Even in ordinary speech it is more usual to say "ich musste einen Arzt rufen lassen" than "ich habe einen Arzt rufen lassen müssen."

#### Separable prefix


As in the [[[The Present Tense (das Präsens)|present tense]],](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Present/Present.html) the finite verb might have a [separable prefix](https://germanstudiesdepartmenaluser.host.dartmouth.edu/Wortbildung/Separables.html), which then goes to the end of the clause:


| Wir kauften immer montags ein.      | We always shopped on Monday.          |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Sie brachte ihren neuen Freund mit. |  She brought her new boyfriend along. |
| Er lud uns dieses Mal nicht ein.    | He didn't invite us this time.        |
| Er rief seine Mutter nie an.        | He never phoned his mother.           |
