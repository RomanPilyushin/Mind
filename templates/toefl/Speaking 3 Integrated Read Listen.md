### Tips

**General Strategies**

- Try to use transitional phrases like “as a result,” “consequently,” “moreover,” and “therefore.”
- Spend about 10-13 seconds summarizing the reading… at most. Remember that most of your score is based on the listening summary.
- Use a mix of simple, compound and complex sentences if possible.
- Paraphrase, but don’t be obsessed.
- Don’t waste time on a conclusion.


**Note-Taking Strategies**

- Set up your page into two columns, with the reading on the right and the lecture on the left.
- Note the title of the reading, and get two or three main points as you read.
- Focus on the specific examples when you take notes from the lecture.
- Use short forms like “x” (no, not, none) and abbreviated words as you take notes from the lecture.
- Once the lecture is finished, immediately add missing details from your memory,
- Clearly label the examples as #1 and #2 so you don’t mix them up.
