### Tips

- Don’t repeat words many times.  Vary your vocabulary.
- Include one long reason and one short reason, like the template says above.
- Or just include one really long reason.  That’s fine too!
- Use transition phrases like “as a result,” “consequently,” “moreover,” and “therefore” to link ideas.
- Use a mix of simple and compound sentences.

- Don’t use a transition like “I feel this way for two reasons.”  That might waste time.
