### Tips

- Don’t repeat words many times.  Vary your vocabulary.
- Include one long reason and one short reason, like the template says above.
- Or just include one really long reason.  That’s fine too!
- Use transition phrases like “as a result,” “consequently,” “moreover,” and “therefore” to link ideas.
- Use a mix of simple and compound sentences.
- Don’t use idioms. They just lead to trouble.
- Don’t use a transition like “I feel this way for two reasons.”  That might waste time.

### Template

**Question One Template (Personal Choice)**

**Main Point (pick one)**

- “I agree with the idea that…”
- “I think it is better to…”
- “I think it is a great/terrible idea to…”

**First Reason**

- “First…” + “For example…” (and a personal example)

**Second Reason**

- “Second…” + “To be more specific…” (and a few more details)



### Prompt

Universities often require students to complete a final research project before graduation. Do you believe this is a valuable requirement? Why or why not?
