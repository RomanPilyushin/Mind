### Tips

Here’s what I recommend: **120 words + one subordinating conjunction + three coordinating conjunctions (two unique)**.

A subordinating conjunction is something like “while” or “when.”  A coordinating conjunction is something like “but” or “so.” Note that “and” isn’t so helpful on the TOEFL.  Don’t count it as one of the three.

### Template


Here’s a template that focuses on expanding on and challenging the points mentioned by the other students.

- This is a challenging topic, but I believe [respond directly to the question]
- I strongly agree with [student]’s perspective that [mention one point made by the student]. 
- Furthermore, [expand on the point with your own idea].
- While [other student] raises a valid point that [mention one point made by the other student], he overlooks the possibility that [challenge that point].
- For instance, [elaborate on your challenge with your own ideas].




Here’s a template that focuses on giving an entirely new answer and ignoring the other student responses.

- While I appreciate the points mentioned by both [STUDENT 1] and [STUDENT 2], I think that… [elaborate on your idea for a few sentences]
- Remember that [elaborate on your point], so [elaborate on your point].
- Some people may feel that [mention a potential challenge], but [respond to this challenge].
