### Prompt


**The Passage:**

The university library is launching a new program called "Silence Zones." These designated areas will have stricter noise regulations to create a quieter environment for students who need to focus on their studies. Eating, talking, and using mobile phones will be prohibited in these zones.

**Listen to a conversation between two students discussing the new program.**

---
**Woman:** (Sighs) This library is getting so loud lately. How am I supposed to concentrate on this research paper with all the chatter?

**Man:** Tell me about it. Maybe they should bring back those "shhh" librarians!

**Woman:** (Laughs) Doubt that would fly these days. But I did see a flyer about a new program called "Silence Zones." Apparently, they're designating specific areas for quiet study.

**Man:** (Raises an eyebrow) Silence Zones? Sounds intense. Do you think it'll work?

**Woman:** I kind of like the idea. Sometimes you just need a space to focus without distractions.

**After listening, answer the following question in 60 seconds. You have 30 seconds to prepare your response.**

**Question:** What is the woman's opinion on the new "Silence Zones" program in the library, and what reasons does she give to support her opinion?
