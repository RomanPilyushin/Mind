### Tips

Set up your note paper so that half of the page is used for reading notes.  Quickly note what the change is.  Then clearly note each of the two reasons for the change, with a few details.  Take a look at my notes, below.  See how I used short forms like “fitness C,” “A/C” and how I use “X” to indicate negatives (can’t, not, etc).

Use the other half of the paper to take notes about the conversation.  Quickly note whether the student agrees or disagrees with the change.  I used “XX” to indicate that they don’t.  Next, note how they respond to each of the reasons in the reading.  Use arrows to show how the reading and listening reasons match up.

### Prompt


**The Passage:**

The university library is launching a new program called "Silence Zones." These designated areas will have stricter noise regulations to create a quieter environment for students who need to focus on their studies. Eating, talking, and using mobile phones will be prohibited in these zones.

**Listen to a conversation between two students discussing the new program.**

---
**Woman:** (Sighs) This library is getting so loud lately. How am I supposed to concentrate on this research paper with all the chatter?

**Man:** Tell me about it. Maybe they should bring back those "shhh" librarians!

**Woman:** (Laughs) Doubt that would fly these days. But I did see a flyer about a new program called "Silence Zones." Apparently, they're designating specific areas for quiet study.

**Man:** (Raises an eyebrow) Silence Zones? Sounds intense. Do you think it'll work?

**Woman:** I kind of like the idea. Sometimes you just need a space to focus without distractions.

**After listening, answer the following question in 60 seconds. You have 30 seconds to prepare your response.**

**Question:** What is the woman's opinion on the new "Silence Zones" program in the library, and what reasons does she give to support her opinion?
