### Tips

- Try to use transitional phrases like “as a result,” “consequently,” “moreover,” “for example” and “therefore.”
- Focus mostly on the examples. Those are most important!
- Use a mix of simple and compound sentences.
- You don’t need a conclusion.

**Note-Taking Strategies**

- Before the lecture begins, divide your paper into two columns – one for each “thing”
- Start by making a note of what is being described 
- Use short forms to take notes faster.
- Use “x” to indicate negatives (don’t, can’t, won’t, never)
