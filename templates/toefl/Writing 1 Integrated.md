### Tips

**Taking Notes**

If you understand how the sources are structured, note-taking should be easy.  You can do something like this:

Here are my notes from the above samples (colonizing asteroids):

**Note-Taking Tips**

- Prepare your paper before the question beings by writing “reading” and “listening” and drawing arrows.
- Even though you will see the article as you write, it is a good idea to take notes.  That will force you to pay attention during the three minutes you have to read it.
- Use short forms like “grav” and “cond” and “effec” to save time.
- Use “x” to refer to negatives (not, no, can’t, etc).
- Immediately after the lecture finishes expand your notes with details still fresh in your head.  I used blue ink to show what I did.
- You will use a pencil on test day.  Not a pen.  Practice with a pencil.

**Pro Tips**

- The lecture summary is the most important part of the essay.  Shorten the reading summary if you need to save time.
- I recommend between 280 and 300 words.
- Use transitional phrases like “in contrast” and “moreover” and “finally” just like I did.
- Always be sure to indicate where the details are from (the reading or the lecture).
- Avoid copying from the reading word for word. Paraphrase as much as you can.
- You don’t need fancy grammatical structures.  The accuracy of your details is more important in this task.
- Save about one minute to proofread your work.
- I maintain a collection of [complete sample essays](https://www.toeflresources.com/sample-toefl-essays/) written using the above technique. Read them!
