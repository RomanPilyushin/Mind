The ARM1 processor, which was the first ARM processor, has some distinct characteristics regarding its instruction set and addressing modes. Here's a breakdown:

### [[Opcode (Operation Code) and Operands|Opcode]] Length:

- **[[Opcode (Operation Code) and Operands|Opcode]] Length**: In ARM1, the opcodes are **32 bits** long. The instruction word in ARM processors is generally 32 bits, and it includes both the operation code ([[Opcode (Operation Code) and Operands|opcode]]) and the operands or addressing information.

### Addressing Modes Supported:

ARM1 supports several addressing modes, which can be categorized broadly into the following:

1. **[[Immediate and Direct Addressing|Immediate Addressing]]**:
    
    - The operand is embedded directly in the instruction.
2. **Register Addressing**:
    
    - The operand is a value contained in a register.
3. **Scaled Register Addressing**:
    
    - The operand is obtained by adding a base register value to an offset register value, optionally shifted by a constant amount.
4. **[[Indirect Addressing]] (Register Indirect)**:
    
    - The address of the operand is given in a register.
5. **Indexed Addressing**:
    
    - Similar to scaled register addressing but with more complex forms, allowing for various ways to calculate the effective address using multiple [[Components of CPU (Central Processing Unit)|registers]].
6. **Base-plus-Offset Addressing**:
    
    - A base register value is combined with a constant offset to form the address of the operand.
7. **Pre-Indexed Addressing**:
    
    - The effective address is calculated using a base register and an offset, and the result is used to access the operand. The base register may be updated with the effective address.
8. **Post-Indexed Addressing**:
    
    - The effective address is calculated using a base register, and the operand is accessed before the base register is updated with the offset.

### Variation of Instructions Across Addressing Modes:

The ARM1 processor uses the same 32-bit instruction format but varies how it interprets the bits depending on the addressing mode being used. Hereâ€™s how the instructions vary:

1. **Instruction Encoding**:
    
    - ARM1 uses conditional execution flags in the uppermost four bits of the instruction. The next part of the instruction is the [[Opcode (Operation Code) and Operands|opcode]], followed by bits that define the addressing mode and the operands ([[Components of CPU (Central Processing Unit)|registers]] or immediate values).
    - Depending on the [[Opcode (Operation Code) and Operands|opcode]] and addressing mode, the instruction may include fields for immediate values, register numbers, or offsets.
2. **Flexible Operand Encoding**:
    
    - ARM1 has a unique feature where the second operand in many instructions can be an immediate value, a register, or a register with an optional shift. This flexibility allows many instructions to adapt to different addressing modes.
3. **Branch Instructions**:
    
    - For branch instructions, the instruction format includes a condition code, a branch [[Opcode (Operation Code) and Operands|opcode]], and a signed 24-bit immediate value that represents the branch offset. The processor calculates the target address by adding this offset to the address of the instruction following the branch.
4. **Load/Store Instructions**:
    
    - Load and Store instructions use addressing modes that calculate the effective address based on a combination of a base register and an immediate offset or another register.

### Summary:

- **[[Opcode (Operation Code) and Operands|Opcode]] Length**: ARM1 uses 32-bit opcodes.
- **Addressing Modes**: ARM1 supports several addressing modes including Immediate, Register, Scaled Register, Indirect, Indexed, Base-plus-Offset, Pre-Indexed, and Post-Indexed.
- **Instruction Variation**: ARM1 varies instructions across addressing modes by encoding the operation, the type of addressing mode, and the operands all within the 32-bit instruction word. This allows ARM1 to use a compact and flexible instruction set that can handle various types of operations and operand accesses.
