### Campus

According to the announcement,

The man opposes this initiative

To begin with, he points out that
Moreover, he argues that



Volunteer Work Within the Community

State University will now require all students to complete ten hours of volunteer work in the local community before graduating. Serving as a volunteer is not only helpful to communities, but also beneficial and convenient for students. When they take time to help others: students experience a deep sense of satisfaction. This sense of fulfillment leads them to continue working within their communities. Furthermore, volunteering will be convenient for students. There are a number of nearby organizations in need of student volunteers, so students can easily arrange to work locally.

The woman expresses her opinion of the university’s new policy. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.
####
Students Need Campus Snack Shop

I think the university should open a snack shop on campus-a snack shop that would be operated entirely by our students. A student-run snack shop would benefit students in two ways. First, it would create a number of job opportunities for students Second, the store would be a convenient place on campus to buy food, providing students with a fast； easy place to get snacks at any time of the day. Sincerely, Julia Wilson

The man expresses his opinion about the letter writer's proposal. Briefly summarize the proposal. Then state the man's opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.

####
Campus Bookstore Should Sell Snacks and Drinks

In addition to selling books and textbooks, I think the campus bookstore should also offer drinks and snacks for sale. The bookstore could have a few chairs and tables available where students could sit and have a snack or something to drink, while the/re looking through books and deciding what to buy. It would also be convenient for students who got hungry between classes, and wanted to grab something to eat before going to their next class Sincerely, Matt Shapiro

The woman expresses her opinion about the proposal described in the letter. Briefly summarize the proposal. Then state her opinion about the proposal and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.

####
Extending Study Period

The university now schedules one study day at the end of every semester for students to prepare for final exams. I suggest that the university consider extending this study period to three days. Most students have exams in several classes. Having only one study day between the end of classes and the beginning of the final exam period is not enough time to prepare for all of the exams. Additionally, having a three- day study period will give students extra time to consult with their professors if they need help or advice before the exam period begins. Sincerely, Robert Steele


The woman expresses her opinion about the proposal in the letter. Briefly summarize the proposal. Then state her opinion about the proposal and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.

####
New Course Credit Policy

Western University allows undergraduate students with a high grade average to take courses in our graduate school programs. Until now, these students received course credit toward their undergraduate degrees. Beginning next year, however, undergraduates taking graduate-level courses will not only receive credit toward their undergraduate degrees: if they go on to enroll as graduate students at Western, they can also apply these credits toward a graduate degree. This new policy will encourage our best undergraduates to take advantage of our graduate course offerings while they are undergraduates and also to make Western University their first choice for graduate school later on. Sincerely, Robert Steele

The man disagrees with the new policy Explain why.


####
Improving Dormitory Kitchen Use

I've noticed that most students don't use the dormitory kitchens, which is unfortunate since students would probably enjoy preparing their own food. I think that the university should make improvements to the dormitory kitchens so that they will be more widely used. There are a few things that the university could do to encourage students to start using the kitchens regularly. First: I think the kitchens should be modernized with new cookware for students to use. Also, I think free cooking classes should be given to stimulate students' interest in cooking and make them want to use the kitchens. Sincerely, Jennifer Adler

The students are discussing a proposal suggested in a letter written to the university newspaper. Briefly summarize the proposal and explain why the man agrees or disagrees with it.

####
Cafeteria for Math Building

Students who are majoring in math spend a lot of time in the math building. I think it would be more convenient for math students if the university turned the large empty room on the first floor of the math building into a small cafeteria Having a cafeteria in the math building would give students a place where they could get something to eat in between classes. Additionally, the university could add a number of electrical outlets to the room so students could recharge their laptops there. Sincerely, Justin Ruben


The letter writer points out a problem with the math building and suggests an improvement. Briefly describe the improvement and explain the reasons why the woman agrees or disagrees with the letter writer’s suggestion.

####
New Parking Lot Location

I was very pleased to read about the university's plans to build a new parking lot to accommodate the growing number of student cars on campus. Since the location for the new lot has not yet been determined, I would like to suggest that Sanders Field be used. Sanders Field has not been used for sports events since the new stadium was built two years ago. Right now: it is wasted space：so it would be an ideal area to turn into something useful like a parking lot. Students who live in the dorms really need a place to park their cars Students living off campus could really use the extra parking, too Sincerely, Jason Hill



####

New Degree Navigator Web Site

Students must complete certain courses in their fields of study in order to meet the requirements for graduation. Currently, students meet with academic advisors to discuss these requirements. Soon, though, students will be able to use a new degree navigator Web site to keep track of their requirements The Web site will make it easier for students to monitor which courses they have already completed and which ones they still need to take before graduating, so they can plan their schedules accordingly Also, the Web site will help reduce the workload for academic advisors, who will not need to meet with students as often.

####
Cafe to be Built in Library

The university has decided to build a cafe in the basement of the library. The reason given for this new development is that university officials believe students will enjoy the convenience of being able to eat without having to leave the library. Students have often complained that their studies are disrupted because they must leave the library whenever they want to eat. Officials also believe that it will help make library study more productive if students have the opportunity to take short breaks in the cafe while they're working. Sincerely, Justin Ruben


### Read Listen

According to the reading, 

The professor elaborates on this

First, he says that

Next, he notes that



Ecosystem Resilience

An ecosystem is a local environment with its complex community of organisms functioning together as a unit. An ecosystem can be damaged by natural disasters or by human activity. If the ecosystem has a limited variety of species, then destroying even one species of plant or animal can change the ecosystem forever. A resilient ecosystem, however, is able to restore itself to its original, pre-disturbance condition. Resilience in an ecosystem is possible when the ecosystem is populated by a large variety of species: if one species is eliminated by a disturbance, other species are able to take the place of that species, which allows the ecosystem to avoid long-term change.

Using the coral reef as an example, explain what it means for an ecosystem to be resilient.

####
Task Partitioning

Different species of insects have different ways of organizing the essential tasks that need to be completed in order for them to survive. One way of accomplishing this process is through task partitioning. Insect groups that use this method divide, or partition, their work into several different stages that are ordered and performed in a fixed sequence by different groups of workers. An important benefit of this technique is increased efficiency, since the workers performing each task are specialized, which saves time and energy.

Explain how the example of leaf-cutter ants illustrates the concept of task partitioning.

####
Compound Nesting

Sometimes two different species of insects live close together, side by side. The two insect groups might even share the same home. But the two species often are different enough that they do not have to compete for the same resources, and therefore they can avoid conflict. This is known as compound nesting. Compound nesting actually provides advantages to both species: because living closely together can result in a specific benefit to each group, benefits that increase both species’ chances of survival.

Explain how the example from the professor‘s lecture illustrates the concept of compound nesting

####
Root Communication

All plants need water in order to grow. In desert environments, however, water is especially scarce. One way that some desert plants attempt to secure an adequate water supply is by maintaining a certain distance between themselves and other plants that might try to compete for the same water They maintain this distance through a process known as root communication. That is, the roots of one plant communicate with the roots of another plant in order to control the amount of distance separating them In this way: the communicating plant is able to protect its precious water supply.

Using the example of the creosote plant from the lecture, explain how root communication helps desert plants to survive.


####
Role Distancing

Throughout our lives, we take on many social roles, such as son or daughter, friend, and parent. Roles help us know how to behave and we are generally comfortable in them. Sometimes, however：people want to separate themselves from a role they are enacting: they want to show that this role does not represent who they really are. When people use their behavior to convey such detachment from a role, they are engaged in role distancing People often use gestures, facial expressions, and tone of voice to distance themselves from roles they are uncomfortable performing

Use the example described by the professor to explain what role distancing is.

####
Deceptive Caching

When food is plentiful, animals often collect and hide extra food to eat when it is scarce. However, other animals may try to steal this stored food: and eat it themselves. To protect their food supply, some animals engage in deceptive caching. Using this technique: animals deceive other animals into thinking that food is hidden in one place： while it is actually hidden somewhere else. Deceptive caching tricks animals that try to steal food, making it harder for them to find the food supply. If their attempts at stealing food are repeatedly unsuccessful, the animals often become discouraged and stop trying to steal hidden food.

Explain how the example of the eastern grey squirrel illustrates the concept of deceptive caching

####
Diffusion Effect in Health Studies

When health education experts want to test the effectiveness of a program designed to improve a particular health condition, they often do a study with two groups of people. One group participates in the program, while the other does not: and the researchers compare the two groups to see if the program was effective in improving health. However, if the groups come into contact during the study, a diffusion effect may occur. Members of the group participating in the program may mistakenly share information about it with members of the other group. This often leads to the results of the study being useless

Explain how the example from the lecture illustrates the concept of a diffusion effect.
####
illusion of Transparency

When we experience strong emotions, we often believe, falsely, that other people can detect those emotions, even if we try to hide them. This false belief, that others can “see through us” and know even our innermost feelings that we try to hide, is called the illusion of transparency. Why are we susceptible to such an illusion? Why do we sometimes believe that our feelings are more obvious to others than they really are? Research suggests that the reason is this: when our emotions are very strong, we focus on them very intently and are extremely aware of them. This heightened awareness of our own feelings causes us to assume that they must be obvious to others as well.


Explain how the professors experience at the dinner party illustrates the illusion of transparency



####

Near Field Sound Detection

Some animals are able to use sound to avoid predators. When sound is produced, it creates vibrations in the surrounding air. These vibrations are known as near-field sounds because they originate： or begin, near the sound source. Most animals are unable to detect these kinds of sounds; however, some animals have an ability known as near-field sound detection This ability allows certain animals to detect vibrations or near-field sounds produced by potential predators Animals with near-field sound detection abilities have special physical features that allow them to sense an approaching predator and take action to protect themselves.

Explain how the example from the professor’s lecture illustrates the concept of near-field sound detection.

####
Paradox of Choice

The freedom to make choices and decisions makes people happy because it gives them a sense of being in control of their lives. However, the fact that having some choice is good does not mean that having more choice is necessarily better, since having too many choices can cause anxiety and dissatisfaction. The main reason for this is that as the number of options available to us increases, the effort required to make a good decision increases as well This phenomenon has been termed the paradox of choice: we like having choices and think that having more choices should please us; but instead, it causes us distress

Explain what is meant by “the paradox of choice”, using the example mentioned by the professor.
