New Course Credit Policy

Western University allows undergraduate students with a high grade average to take courses in our graduate school programs. Until now, these students received course credit toward their undergraduate degrees. Beginning next year, however, undergraduates taking graduate-level courses will not only receive credit toward their undergraduate degrees: if they go on to enroll as graduate students at Western, they can also apply these credits toward a graduate degree. This new policy will encourage our best undergraduates to take advantage of our graduate course offerings while they are undergraduates and also to make Western University their first choice for graduate school later on. Sincerely, Robert Steele

The man disagrees with the new policy Explain why.

Improving Dormitory Kitchen Use

I've noticed that most students don't use the dormitory kitchens, which is unfortunate since students would probably enjoy preparing their own food. I think that the university should make improvements to the dormitory kitchens so that they will be more widely used. There are a few things that the university could do to encourage students to start using the kitchens regularly. First: I think the kitchens should be modernized with new cookware for students to use. Also, I think free cooking classes should be given to stimulate students' interest in cooking and make them want to use the kitchens. Sincerely, Jennifer Adler

The students are discussing a proposal suggested in a letter written to the university newspaper. Briefly summarize the proposal and explain why the man agrees or disagrees with it.

####
Cafeteria for Math Building

Students who are majoring in math spend a lot of time in the math building. I think it would be more convenient for math students if the university turned the large empty room on the first floor of the math building into a small cafeteria Having a cafeteria in the math building would give students a place where they could get something to eat in between classes. Additionally, the university could add a number of electrical outlets to the room so students could recharge their laptops there. Sincerely, Justin Ruben


The letter writer points out a problem with the math building and suggests an improvement. Briefly describe the improvement and explain the reasons why the woman agrees or disagrees with the letter writer’s suggestion.

####
New Parking Lot Location

I was very pleased to read about the university's plans to build a new parking lot to accommodate the growing number of student cars on campus. Since the location for the new lot has not yet been determined, I would like to suggest that Sanders Field be used. Sanders Field has not been used for sports events since the new stadium was built two years ago. Right now: it is wasted space：so it would be an ideal area to turn into something useful like a parking lot. Students who live in the dorms really need a place to park their cars Students living off campus could really use the extra parking, too Sincerely, Jason Hill

New Degree Navigator Web Site

Students must complete certain courses in their fields of study in order to meet the requirements for graduation. Currently, students meet with academic advisors to discuss these requirements. Soon, though, students will be able to use a new degree navigator Web site to keep track of their requirements The Web site will make it easier for students to monitor which courses they have already completed and which ones they still need to take before graduating, so they can plan their schedules accordingly Also, the Web site will help reduce the workload for academic advisors, who will not need to meet with students as often.

####
Cafe to be Built in Library

The university has decided to build a cafe in the basement of the library. The reason given for this new development is that university officials believe students will enjoy the convenience of being able to eat without having to leave the library. Students have often complained that their studies are disrupted because they must leave the library whenever they want to eat. Officials also believe that it will help make library study more productive if students have the opportunity to take short breaks in the cafe while they're working. Sincerely, Justin Ruben

####
Role Distancing

Throughout our lives, we take on many social roles, such as son or daughter, friend, and parent. Roles help us know how to behave and we are generally comfortable in them. Sometimes, however：people want to separate themselves from a role they are enacting: they want to show that this role does not represent who they really are. When people use their behavior to convey such detachment from a role, they are engaged in role distancing People often use gestures, facial expressions, and tone of voice to distance themselves from roles they are uncomfortable performing

Use the example described by the professor to explain what role distancing is.

####
Deceptive Caching

When food is plentiful, animals often collect and hide extra food to eat when it is scarce. However, other animals may try to steal this stored food: and eat it themselves. To protect their food supply, some animals engage in deceptive caching. Using this technique: animals deceive other animals into thinking that food is hidden in one place： while it is actually hidden somewhere else. Deceptive caching tricks animals that try to steal food, making it harder for them to find the food supply. If their attempts at stealing food are repeatedly unsuccessful, the animals often become discouraged and stop trying to steal hidden food.

Explain how the example of the eastern grey squirrel illustrates the concept of deceptive caching

####
Diffusion Effect in Health Studies

When health education experts want to test the effectiveness of a program designed to improve a particular health condition, they often do a study with two groups of people. One group participates in the program, while the other does not: and the researchers compare the two groups to see if the program was effective in improving health. However, if the groups come into contact during the study, a diffusion effect may occur. Members of the group participating in the program may mistakenly share information about it with members of the other group. This often leads to the results of the study being useless

Explain how the example from the lecture illustrates the concept of a diffusion effect.
####
illusion of Transparency

When we experience strong emotions, we often believe, falsely, that other people can detect those emotions, even if we try to hide them. This false belief, that others can “see through us” and know even our innermost feelings that we try to hide, is called the illusion of transparency. Why are we susceptible to such an illusion? Why do we sometimes believe that our feelings are more obvious to others than they really are? Research suggests that the reason is this: when our emotions are very strong, we focus on them very intently and are extremely aware of them. This heightened awareness of our own feelings causes us to assume that they must be obvious to others as well.


Explain how the professors experience at the dinner party illustrates the illusion of transparency



####

Near Field Sound Detection

Some animals are able to use sound to avoid predators. When sound is produced, it creates vibrations in the surrounding air. These vibrations are known as near-field sounds because they originate： or begin, near the sound source. Most animals are unable to detect these kinds of sounds; however, some animals have an ability known as near-field sound detection This ability allows certain animals to detect vibrations or near-field sounds produced by potential predators Animals with near-field sound detection abilities have special physical features that allow them to sense an approaching predator and take action to protect themselves.

Explain how the example from the professor’s lecture illustrates the concept of near-field sound detection.

####
Paradox of Choice

The freedom to make choices and decisions makes people happy because it gives them a sense of being in control of their lives. However, the fact that having some choice is good does not mean that having more choice is necessarily better, since having too many choices can cause anxiety and dissatisfaction. The main reason for this is that as the number of options available to us increases, the effort required to make a good decision increases as well This phenomenon has been termed the paradox of choice: we like having choices and think that having more choices should please us; but instead, it causes us distress

Explain what is meant by “the paradox of choice”, using the example mentioned by the professor.
