New Degree Navigator Web Site

Students must complete certain courses in their fields of study in order to meet the requirements for graduation. Currently, students meet with academic advisors to discuss these requirements. Soon, though, students will be able to use a new degree navigator Web site to keep track of their requirements The Web site will make it easier for students to monitor which courses they have already completed and which ones they still need to take before graduating, so they can plan their schedules accordingly Also, the Web site will help reduce the workload for academic advisors, who will not need to meet with students as often.

Cafe to be Built in Library

The university has decided to build a cafe in the basement of the library. The reason given for this new development is that university officials believe students will enjoy the convenience of being able to eat without having to leave the library. Students have often complained that their studies are disrupted because they must leave the library whenever they want to eat. Officials also believe that it will help make library study more productive if students have the opportunity to take short breaks in the cafe while they're working. Sincerely, Justin Ruben

Near Field Sound Detection

Some animals are able to use sound to avoid predators. When sound is produced, it creates vibrations in the surrounding air. These vibrations are known as near-field sounds because they originate： or begin, near the sound source. Most animals are unable to detect these kinds of sounds; however, some animals have an ability known as near-field sound detection This ability allows certain animals to detect vibrations or near-field sounds produced by potential predators Animals with near-field sound detection abilities have special physical features that allow them to sense an approaching predator and take action to protect themselves.

Explain how the example from the professor’s lecture illustrates the concept of near-field sound detection.

####
Paradox of Choice

The freedom to make choices and decisions makes people happy because it gives them a sense of being in control of their lives. However, the fact that having some choice is good does not mean that having more choice is necessarily better, since having too many choices can cause anxiety and dissatisfaction. The main reason for this is that as the number of options available to us increases, the effort required to make a good decision increases as well This phenomenon has been termed the paradox of choice: we like having choices and think that having more choices should please us; but instead, it causes us distress

Explain what is meant by “the paradox of choice”, using the example mentioned by the professor.
