### 1. **Control Bus:**

- **Purpose**: The Control Bus is responsible for carrying control signals that coordinate the operations of the CPU, memory, and other peripherals. These signals are used to manage and control the various components of the computer.
- **Role**: It tells the CPU and other devices what operations to perform (e.g., read or write). It also carries signals for interrupt requests, clock signals, and status signals.

### 2. **Address Bus:**

- **Purpose**: The Address Bus carries the addresses of memory locations where data needs to be accessed or stored. It essentially tells the system where to look in memory for data or where to place data.
- **Role**: It is a unidirectional bus, meaning it only carries signals in one direction, from the CPU to memory or other devices. The width of the address bus determines the maximum addressable memory space (e.g., a 32-bit address bus can address 2^32 memory locations).

### 3. **Data Bus:**

- **Purpose**: The Data Bus is used to transfer actual data between the CPU, memory, and other peripherals. It is the channel through which data travels to and from the CPU.
- **Role**: Unlike the address bus, the data bus is typically bidirectional, meaning it can carry data both to and from the CPU. The width of the data bus (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit) determines how much data can be transferred at once.

### **How They Work Together:**

- When the CPU wants to read or write data, it first sends an address via the Address Bus to specify the memory location.
- The Control Bus then sends a signal indicating whether the operation is a read or write.
- Finally, the data is transferred between the CPU and memory (or other peripherals) over the Data Bus.

Together, these buses enable the CPU to interact with memory and other components, making it possible for the system to execute instructions and process data efficiently.
