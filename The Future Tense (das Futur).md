### Introduction

The Future Tense, known as _das Futur_ in German, is used to describe actions or events that will happen in the future. While German often uses the [[The Present Tense (das Präsens)|present tense]] with a time adverb (e.g., _morgen_, _nächste Woche_) to talk about the future, _das Futur_ provides a way to clearly indicate future intentions, predictions, or assumptions.


### Formation of _das Futur_

_Das Futur_ is formed using two components:

1. **Auxiliary Verb**: _werden_ (will)
2. **Main Verb in the Infinitive**: The main verb remains in its infinitive form.

#### 1. **Conjugation of the Auxiliary Verb _werden_**

The verb _werden_ is conjugated according to the subject of the sentence:

- **ich werde** (I will)
- **du wirst** (you will - informal singular)
- **er/sie/es wird** (he/she/it will)
- **wir werden** (we will)
- **ihr werdet** (you all will - informal plural)
- **sie/Sie werden** (they/you will - formal singular and plural)

#### 2. **Main Verb in the Infinitive**

The main verb in _das Futur_ is always in its infinitive form and is placed at the end of the sentence.

**Example with the verb _machen_ (to do/make):**

- **ich werde machen** (I will do)
- **du wirst machen** (you will do - informal singular)
- **er/sie/es wird machen** (he/she/it will do)
- **wir werden machen** (we will do)
- **ihr werdet machen** (you all will do - informal plural)
- **sie/Sie werden machen** (they/you will do - formal singular and plural)



### Sentence Structure in _das Futur_

The structure of a sentence in _das Futur_ is as follows:

**Subject + Auxiliary Verb (werden) + Other Elements + Main Verb (infinitive)**

**Example Sentences:**

- _Ich werde morgen einkaufen gehen._ (I will go shopping tomorrow.)
- _Er wird nächsten Monat nach Berlin reisen._ (He will travel to Berlin next month.)



### Usage of _das Futur_

_Das Futur_ is used in several contexts:

1. **To describe future actions or events**:
    
    - _Wir werden nächste Woche die Prüfung schreiben._ (We will take the exam next week.)
    - _Sie wird bald ankommen._ (She will arrive soon.)
2. **To make predictions or assumptions about the future**:
    
    - _Es wird regnen._ (It will rain.)
    - _Du wirst erfolgreich sein._ (You will be successful.)
3. **To express intentions or plans for the future**:
    
    - _Ich werde heute Abend ein Buch lesen._ (I will read a book this evening.)
4. **To express assumptions or guesses** (often similar to the English use of "probably" or "might"):
    
    - _Er wird wohl zu Hause sein._ (He is probably at home.)
    - _Das wird teuer sein._ (That will be expensive.)



### Key Points:

- **Time Indicators**: While _das Futur_ clearly indicates future actions, time indicators like _morgen_ (tomorrow), _nächste Woche_ (next week), and _bald_ (soon) are often used to specify when the action will occur.
- **[[The Present Tense (das Präsens)|Present Tense]] for Future Actions**: In everyday spoken German, the [[The Present Tense (das Präsens)|present tense]] is often used with a future time indicator to talk about future actions.
    - Example: _Ich gehe morgen ins Kino._ (I am going to the cinema tomorrow.)


### Example Sentences in _das Futur_:

- _Ich werde nach der Arbeit joggen._ (I will go jogging after work.)
- _Sie werden das Haus renovieren._ (They will renovate the house.)
- _Wirst du mit uns kommen?_ (Will you come with us?)

In summary, _das Futur_ is a straightforward tense used to express future intentions, predictions, and assumptions in German. While it is essential for clarity, especially in written or formal contexts, the [[The Present Tense (das Präsens)|present tense]] often serves a similar function in everyday speech when accompanied by time indicators.


### Dartmouth
#### **The Future Tense in English:**


1) by using the progressive [[The Present Tense (das Präsens)|present tense]] when the context makes the future meaning clear:

|   |
|---|
|"I'm seeing her tomorrow."|
|"We're taking the test on Friday."|


2) by combining the verbs "will" or, less frequently, "shall" with the infinitive, not including "to":

|   |
|---|
|"I will do it tomorrow."|
|"We shall see."|


3) by combining the verb "to go" in the progressive present form with the infinitive, including "to":

|   |
|---|
|"I am going to pay you back when I get my allowance."|
|"Someday she's going to get her comeuppance."|




The future tense can also indicate a present likelihood:

|   |
|---|
|"You'll surely be surprised by what I just said."|
|"She will probably be wondering what has delayed us."|
|"Boys will be boys."|



English has a [[The Future Perfect Tense (das Futur II)|future perfect]] tense to talk about a past event from the perspective of the future:

|   |
|---|
|"I will have finished the paper by Monday."|
|"By the time you get this letter I will have gone to Rio."|



The [[The Future Perfect Tense (das Futur II)|future perfect]] tense is also used to indicate a past likelihood, one that has consequences for the present or future:

|   |
|---|
|"As you will have already heard, the gym will be closed today"|
|"You will have noticed that we no longer have a convertible."|


#### **The Future Tense in German:**


Like English, German can talk about future events in the [[The Present Tense (das Präsens)|present tense]] when the context is clear:

|                                     |                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Wir essen heute Abend in der Küche. | We're eating in the kitchen tonight. |
| Wir sehen uns morgen.               | We're meeting tomorrow.              |
| Er macht das erst Samstag.          | He's not doing that until Saturday.  |



Otherwise German uses the auxiliary verb "werden" with the infinitive:

|                                           |                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Sie wird dir alles sagen.                 | She'll tell you everything.          |
| In zehn Jahren werde ich zu alt sein.     | In ten years, I'll be too old.       |
| Die Kinder werden das nicht sehen wollen. | The children won't want to see that. |




Like English, German can also express present probability with the future tense, often in combination with adverbs such as "bestimmt" (certainly), "sicher" (certainly), "vielleicht" (perhaps), "wahrscheinlich" (probably), or "wohl" (probably):

|                                                 |                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Die Kinder werden wohl schon zu Hause sein.   | The children will probably already be home.             |
| Du wirst uns vielleicht besuchen wollen.      | You will perhaps want to visit us.                      |
| Er wird jetzt bestimmt vorm Fernseher sitzen. | He'll surely be sitting in front of the television now. |
