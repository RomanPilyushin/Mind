#### W2 - AI

This is a challenging topic, but I believe that the [benefits of] AI [outweigh] the threats.

I strongly support David's opinion that AI could help us solve many vital problems and will [improve] our [quality of life].
Moreover, while AI will disrupt [manual jobs], it will create new [opportunities] such as maintaining AI infrastructure, improving robots, and [so on].

While Megan raises a valid point that AI must be [free of biases], she overlooks the possibility of developing AI [through] public funding [rather than] relying [on] profit-driven corporations.
Governments could fund AI projects with [the aim of] building unbiased and ethical systems.

#### W1 - The Phoenicians

The author discusses the [possibility that] the Phoenicians may not have circumnavigated Africa, while the lecturer opposes this [view].

First, the author argues that the Phoenicians used ships for trading along the coast.
Furthermore, he adds that their ships were small, made [of] wood and have limited storage for cargo.
Additionally, he notes that this type of ships [was] not suitable for long-distance expeditions and not strong enough [to withstand] the power of the ocean.
However, the lecturer [casts doubt to] the author's arguments.
He states that the Phoenicians incorporated metal plates in their ships and had [the skills] to repair and maintain their boats during long sea journeys.

Second, the author of the reading notes that there are [many] geographical obstacles, such as The Cape of Good Hope, [along the route around] Africa.
Moreover, even modern ships with advanced navigation systems experience problems [navigating] this particular part of South Africa's coastal line.
On the other hand, the lecturer counters this argument.
The Phoenicians had trading routes near this coastal line and were skilled enough to navigate their ships using [celestial objects].

Finally, the author says that there [is] no evidence that the ancient nation even tried to reach Africa.
Additionally, their interests lay in the realm of [establishing trading] routes in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.
In contrast, the lecturer states that there is a reason [why] it is not correct.
In ancient Egypt, there was a writing in which has been depicted the boat and the ancient nation which landed on the coast of Africa.
Moreover, in ancient Greece, a historian made [a reference to sailors] who circumnavigated the African continent.


#### W2 - Taxing Unhealthy Products

This is a challenging topic, but I believe that taxing unhealthy products should be implemented.
I strongly agree with Sam's opinion that these type of products, which contain high percentages of sugar, salt, and fat could be a main cause of health issues.
Furthermore, companies that produce junk food offer alternative versions of their products that contain minimal amounts of salt and sugar.
While Tanya rises a valid point that these products target vulnerable groups who lack means for proper food, she overlooks the possibility of healthy alternatives such as chicken, affordable fruits and, nuts.
Additionally, low-income individuals tend to consume frozen meals, which are among the most dangerous of junk foods provided by supermarkets.

#### W1 - Peregrine Falcons
Both the author and the lecturer discuss methods to increase the peregrine falcon population.
However, while the author presents three different approaches addressing this issue, the lecturer supports none of them. 

First, the article underscores the importance of protecting nesting sites of peregrine falcons.
Due to the specific locations of the nests, such as cliffs and tall buildings, nest sites could be destroyed by humans.
The author suggests convincing landlords and developers to safeguard these sites.
However, the lecturer does not agree with the article's statement, arguing that the sites would be difficult to identify and protect.
Additionally, the nests could be located on private property.
Furthermore, finding a balance between human and bird needs is difficult.

Second, the author argues that protection and control of the entire population could help because falcons are very vulnerable while they are young.
There is an idea to use non-lethal weapons and relocate birds to safer areas.
The lecturer, however, challenges this initiative as well.
He notes that artificial control can lead to unintended consequences such as an increase in the population of other species that prey on falcons.

Finally, the author suggests treating sick and injured falcons affected by pollution and human interference and then releasing them back into the wild.
On the other hand, the lecturer says that this is an expensive and time-consuming process that could only help individual birds.
Furthermore, he also points out that many other factors pose greater threats to the population as a whole.



#### W2 - Grading Students

This is a challenging topic, but I believe that students should be graded.
I strongly agree with Jake's opinion that grades serve as a genuine benchmark for measuring students' knowledge.
Furthermore, using grades could potentially foster the competitive environment for students, leading them to deeper understanding the content of the lectures and improving their performance during exam sessions. 
While Lila raises the valid point that the students might focus too much on grades, she overlooks the possibility that without grading, students might only mimic the process of studying and fall into a cycle of self-deception.
For instance, the students might open a textbook, listen to a lecture and take notes.
However, after exams, which test their real understanding of the course material, they might enter a state of near depression.

#### W1 - The Late Bronze Age Collapse

The article and the lecture both discuss the Late Bronze Age Collapse.
While the author of the reading presents three different possible causes for this event, the lecturer supports none of them.

First, the article emphasizes that climate change caused drought and famine, which limited food supply to the region.
Also, the author notes that earthquakes and other natural disasters amplified these problems.
But the lecture does not agree with the author's argument because there is no evidence to support this theory, and the climate was stable. 
Additionally, many civilizations before and after experienced the same types of problems, but none of these civilizations faded out.
Moreover, the earthquake or other natural disasters cannot collapse the civilization at the exact same time.

Second, the author argues that the sea pirates called "Sea People" caused the collapse.
According to the reading, they had possession of sailing technology and advanced military tactics.
Furthermore, the pirates attacked coastal areas and destroyed trade routes, leading to the collapse of the civilization.
In contrast, the lecturer argues that these pirates were just a small group and could have been easily suppressed by local armies.
Additionally, these pirates did not have the ability to work together as a coordinated force.

Finally, the article notes that the political and economic systems in the civilizations were controlled by local elites and this modus operandi leaded to instability in the region.
However, the lecturer points out that many civilizations experienced the same type of issues without collapsing.
For example, he mentioned that the Assyrian civilization faced the similar problems but managed to address them and continued to prosper.
