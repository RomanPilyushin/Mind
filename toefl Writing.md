#### W1 - The Late Bronze Age Collapse

The article and the lecture both discuss the Late Bronze Age Collapse.
While the author of the reading presents three different possible causes for this event, the lecturer supports none of them.

First, the article emphasizes that climate change caused drought and famine, which limited food supply to the region.
Also, the author notes that earthquakes and other natural disasters amplified these problems.
But the lecture does not agree with the author's argument because there is no evidence to support this theory, and the climate was stable. 
Additionally, many civilizations before and after experienced the same types of problems, but none of these civilizations faded out.
Moreover, the earthquake or other natural disasters cannot collapse the civilization at the exact same time.

Second, the author argues that the sea pirates called "Sea People" caused the collapse.
According to the reading, they had possession of sailing technology and advanced military tactics.
Furthermore, the pirates attacked coastal areas and destroyed trade routes, leading to the collapse of the civilization.
In contrast, the lecturer argues that these pirates were just a small group and could have been easily suppressed by local armies.
Additionally, these pirates did not have the ability to work together as a coordinated force.

Finally, the article notes that the political and economic systems in the civilizations were controlled by local elites and this modus operandi leaded to instability in the region.
However, the lecturer points out that many civilizations experienced the same type of issues without collapsing.
For example, he mentioned that the Assyrian civilization faced the similar problems but managed to address them and continued to prosper.


#### W2 - Grading Students

This is a challenging topic, but I believe that students should be graded.
I strongly agree with Jake's opinion that grades serve as a genuine benchmark for measuring students' knowledge.
Furthermore, using grades could potentially foster the competitive environment for students, leading them to deeper understanding the content of the lectures and improving their performance during exam sessions. 
While Lila raises the valid point that the students might focus too much on grades, she overlooks the possibility that without grading, students might only mimic the process of studying and fall into a cycle of self-deception.
For instance, the students might open a textbook, listen to a lecture and take notes.
However, after exams, which test their real understanding of the course material, they might enter a state of near depression.
