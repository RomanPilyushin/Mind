#### W2 - Economic Growth

This is a challenging topic, but I believe that economic growth [carries more weight] than protection of the environment.

I strongly support Maggie's opinion that economic growth is [essential] to [solving] our problems.
Furthermore, without [a] strong economy, we cannot provide jobs, food, and strong education to people.
Additionally, for swiftly switch to renewable sources, people have to reduce their energy consumption.
However, sometimes people just want to use [the] benefits of fossil fuel[s] without overthink.

While Alex's opinion holds merit and underscore[s] some potential benefits, he overlooks the possibility that renewable energy is not [as] efficient as traditional energy.
Moreover, to invest in renewable sources of energy, we need strong economic growth to generate [the] means for capital investments and [to] research more effective forms of energy.












































#### W1 - Machu Picchu

The author presents three possible purposes for Machu Picchu.
However, the lecturer [questions] these arguments.

First, the author notes that Machu Picchu was constructed as a permanent royal estate for the Inca emperor.
The mountain top was an ideal location for the emperor [to showcase] his wealth and power to his guests and could help him maintain control of the empire.
On the other hand, the lecturer argues that [its] remoteness from the center of the empire would have been an obstacle for the ruler.
This estate [was] suited more as a temporary vacation house, not as a main building.

Second, the author underscores that Machu Picchu was a religious center. 
The Inca were a very religious, and, possibly, this temple was further evidence of their dedication to their gods.
However, the lecturer casts doubt on [the] author's argument.
He emphasizes that there is [a] lack of evidence that Machu Picchu served as a temple.
In other temple[s], there are clear indications of religious activities.

Lastly, the author [suggests] that Machu Picchu was a defensive fortress.
The building's location at the top of a mountain, surround[ed] by steep cliffs, served as a natural shield from [invaders] and [eased the burden] of [defending] the fortress.
In response, the lecturer argues that there is no evidence that the building's purpose was [for] defence.
Only a few tools and some weapons were found in Machu Picchu, [whereas] Inca weapons were found at other sites.





























































#### W2 - University Spending

This is a challenging topic, but I believe the academic facilities like libraries [carry] more weight than sports programs [when it comes to university funding].

I strongly support Rachel's opinion that academic facilities provide [significant] benefits for students and help [them] attain their professional goals.
Moreover, [investing in] academic facilities and amenities, such as contemporary computer classes, grants, scholarships, and access to the top-notch academic journals, would be a wise investment in the bright future of [both] the students and the university.

While the Mike's opinion hold[s] merit, he overlooks the possibility that sports [are] an integral part of the student life, but they are only one part.
Moreover, if the university is able to fund sport events and provide sports scholarships, it is [beneficial].
However, the [primary] purpose of the academia is to produce great scientists and industrial professionals.






























#### W1 - Living on the Moon

The author presents three hardships which humanity will face if it tries to colonize the Moon.
However, the lecturer challenges these obstacles and provides solutions for each of them.

First, the author notes that the Moon does not have [a] substantial atmosphere like Earth.
He adds that the atmosphere safeguards us from meteoroids and solar radiation.
Furthermore, achieving [an] advanced level of technology to mitigate this obstacle will take a lot of time.
On the other hand, the lecturer argues that we have low-tech solutions avaliable today [that] could address this problem.
Additionally, Moon soil could be used [to] protect human colony from deadly meteoroids and radiation.

Second, the author underscores that the Moon has meagre stocks of essential resources for humans, such as air and soil.
Moreover, the transportation of these resources would be a hefty sum.
[In response], the lecturer argues that the Moon has [an] immense amount of frozen water located [at] its North Pole.
Furthermore, using this frozen water, [a] human colony could generate air, rocket fuel, and even grow green plants using a [technique] called hydroponics.

Finally, the author says that humans in deep space experience psychological and social problem[s], [due to] isolation for extended periods.
Moreover, the lack of natural environment could exacerbate psychological issues.
In contrast, the lecturer [casts doubt on] the author's arguments.
He emphasizes that these issues could be resolved with regular communications with Earth.
Additionally, open spaces and natural lighting can also help to tackle these hardships.



































#### W2 - Longevity

This is a challenging question, but I believe the advanced medical technology brings more weight than the government services.

I strongly support Lisa's opinion that recent breakthroughs in medicine paved the way to our long[er] lives.
Moreover, in the near future the computational approach [will] help us break the code of [longevity] and provide formulas [for] a pill to [achieve] eternal life.

While John raises a valid point that the government plays a significant role in the [betterment] of our health, he overlooks the possibility that only a human as individual could change his life and improve his health.
Furthermore, if [someone] wants to smoke a cigarette, [no] government [campaigns] against smoking [will] help.


#### W1 - Olive Trees

The author presents three solutions how to save trees from a disease called quick decline syndrome (QDS). However, the lecturer argues that there are potential drawbacks.

First, the author suggests to detect signs of the disease as early as possible. 
These signs could [include] yellow leaves, slow grow[th], or dying branches. 
If a particular tree [shows any] of these signs, it needs to be removed.
On the other hand, the lecturer says [that] this could be a time-consuming and expensive option.
Moreover, [in] the early stages it would be difficult to detect the disease.

Second, the author notes that the improving [the] overall health of trees would also help to resist.
The procedures such as proper irrigation, fertilization, and trimming safeguard trees.
Also, planting saplings could provide an additional level of protection.
However, the lecture challenges [these] suggestions.
These procedures do note guarantee anything and could be extremly expensive.

Finally, the autor suggests that chemicals could be a shield for trees.
The farmers have to control the population of insects using insecticides.
Additionally, [predators] such as ladybugs and wasps which hunt for this type of insects could provide more benefits in protection.
However, the lecturer calls this into question as well.
Insects could adapt to the chemicals that we use.
Fu[r]thermore, we are not able to control [predators] and they can just fly away where the population of such insects [is] higher.

#### W2 - AI

This is a challenging topic, but I believe that the [benefits of] AI [outweigh] the threats.

I strongly support David's opinion that AI could help us solve many vital problems and will [improve] our [quality of life].
Moreover, while AI will disrupt [manual jobs], it will create new [opportunities] such as maintaining AI infrastructure, improving robots, and [so on].

While Megan raises a valid point that AI must be [free of biases], she overlooks the possibility of developing AI [through] public funding [rather than] relying [on] profit-driven corporations.
Governments could fund AI projects with [the aim of] building unbiased and ethical systems.

#### W1 - The Phoenicians

The author discusses the [possibility that] the Phoenicians may not have circumnavigated Africa, while the lecturer opposes this [view].

First, the author argues that the Phoenicians used ships for trading along the coast.
Furthermore, he adds that their ships were small, made [of] wood and have limited storage for cargo.
Additionally, he notes that this type of ships [was] not suitable for long-distance expeditions and not strong enough [to withstand] the power of the ocean.
However, the lecturer [casts doubt to] the author's arguments.
He states that the Phoenicians incorporated metal plates in their ships and had [the skills] to repair and maintain their boats during long sea journeys.

Second, the author of the reading notes that there are [many] geographical obstacles, such as The Cape of Good Hope, [along the route around] Africa.
Moreover, even modern ships with advanced navigation systems experience problems [navigating] this particular part of South Africa's coastal line.
On the other hand, the lecturer counters this argument.
The Phoenicians had trading routes near this coastal line and were skilled enough to navigate their ships using [celestial objects].

Finally, the author says that there [is] no evidence that the ancient nation even tried to reach Africa.
Additionally, their interests lay in the realm of [establishing trading] routes in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.
In contrast, the lecturer states that there is a reason [why] it is not correct.
In ancient Egypt, there was a writing in which has been depicted the boat and the ancient nation which landed on the coast of Africa.
Moreover, in ancient Greece, a historian made [a reference to sailors] who circumnavigated the African continent.


#### W2 - Taxing Unhealthy Products

This is a challenging topic, but I believe that taxing unhealthy products should be implemented.
I strongly agree with Sam's opinion that these type of products, which contain high percentages of sugar, salt, and fat could be a main cause of health issues.
Furthermore, companies that produce junk food offer alternative versions of their products that contain minimal amounts of salt and sugar.
While Tanya rises a valid point that these products target vulnerable groups who lack means for proper food, she overlooks the possibility of healthy alternatives such as chicken, affordable fruits and, nuts.
Additionally, low-income individuals tend to consume frozen meals, which are among the most dangerous of junk foods provided by supermarkets.

#### W1 - Peregrine Falcons
Both the author and the lecturer discuss methods to increase the peregrine falcon population.
However, while the author presents three different approaches addressing this issue, the lecturer supports none of them. 

First, the article underscores the importance of protecting nesting sites of peregrine falcons.
Due to the specific locations of the nests, such as cliffs and tall buildings, nest sites could be destroyed by humans.
The author suggests convincing landlords and developers to safeguard these sites.
However, the lecturer does not agree with the article's statement, arguing that the sites would be difficult to identify and protect.
Additionally, the nests could be located on private property.
Furthermore, finding a balance between human and bird needs is difficult.

Second, the author argues that protection and control of the entire population could help because falcons are very vulnerable while they are young.
There is an idea to use non-lethal weapons and relocate birds to safer areas.
The lecturer, however, challenges this initiative as well.
He notes that artificial control can lead to unintended consequences such as an increase in the population of other species that prey on falcons.

Finally, the author suggests treating sick and injured falcons affected by pollution and human interference and then releasing them back into the wild.
On the other hand, the lecturer says that this is an expensive and time-consuming process that could only help individual birds.
Furthermore, he also points out that many other factors pose greater threats to the population as a whole.



#### W2 - Grading Students

This is a challenging topic, but I believe that students should be graded.
I strongly agree with Jake's opinion that grades serve as a genuine benchmark for measuring students' knowledge.
Furthermore, using grades could potentially foster the competitive environment for students, leading them to deeper understanding the content of the lectures and improving their performance during exam sessions. 
While Lila raises the valid point that the students might focus too much on grades, she overlooks the possibility that without grading, students might only mimic the process of studying and fall into a cycle of self-deception.
For instance, the students might open a textbook, listen to a lecture and take notes.
However, after exams, which test their real understanding of the course material, they might enter a state of near depression.

#### W1 - The Late Bronze Age Collapse

The article and the lecture both discuss the Late Bronze Age Collapse.
While the author of the reading presents three different possible causes for this event, the lecturer supports none of them.

First, the article emphasizes that climate change caused drought and famine, which limited food supply to the region.
Also, the author notes that earthquakes and other natural disasters amplified these problems.
But the lecture does not agree with the author's argument because there is no evidence to support this theory, and the climate was stable. 
Additionally, many civilizations before and after experienced the same types of problems, but none of these civilizations faded out.
Moreover, the earthquake or other natural disasters cannot collapse the civilization at the exact same time.

Second, the author argues that the sea pirates called "Sea People" caused the collapse.
According to the reading, they had possession of sailing technology and advanced military tactics.
Furthermore, the pirates attacked coastal areas and destroyed trade routes, leading to the collapse of the civilization.
In contrast, the lecturer argues that these pirates were just a small group and could have been easily suppressed by local armies.
Additionally, these pirates did not have the ability to work together as a coordinated force.

Finally, the article notes that the political and economic systems in the civilizations were controlled by local elites and this modus operandi leaded to instability in the region.
However, the lecturer points out that many civilizations experienced the same type of issues without collapsing.
For example, he mentioned that the Assyrian civilization faced the similar problems but managed to address them and continued to prosper.
