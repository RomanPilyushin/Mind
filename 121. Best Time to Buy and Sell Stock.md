### Problem

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`


### Input Output

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`


### Solution

```cpp
int bestTime::maxProfit(std::vector<int>& prices) {  
  
    if (prices.empty()) {  
        return 0; // No profit if the array is empty  
    }  
  
    int profit = 0;  
    int minPrice = prices[0];  
  
    for (const auto& currentPrice : prices) {  
        if (currentPrice < minPrice)  
            minPrice = currentPrice; // Update the minimum price  
        else if (currentPrice - minPrice > profit)  
            profit = currentPrice - minPrice; // Update the profit  
    }  
  
    return profit;  
}
```
